    "text": "The Silent Geriatric Giant\n“It takes a child one year to acquire independent movement and ten years to acquire independent mobility. An old person can lose both in a day.” — Professor Bernard Issacs\n\nThe term “geriatric giants” was coined by Professor Bernard Issacs in 1965 to describe a group of conditions: immobility, incontinence, instability, and impaired intellect. These conditions are considered “giants” due to their high prevalence and the immense burden of suffering they impose on the geriatric population, necessitating medical and social intervention. Over the years, extensive research has focused on these giants, making them a primary target for geriatricians.\nRecently, Professor Duque and colleagues from the Australian Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences identified an even larger giant: Osteosarcopenia. In a 2021 article published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging, they highlighted the twin problem of Osteosarcopenia. On one hand, it is highly prevalent, and its impact is profound. On the other hand, it has not received the equal recognition and precedence in clinical practice.\nDuring the first decade of our life, we develop a high level of independence and mobility, strongly associated with progressive increases in muscle and bone mass. However, by the third decade, this peak begins to decline. In a significant proportion of older individuals, several risk factors contribute to both Osteoporosis (decreased bone mass with micro-architectural deterioration) and Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass, strength, and function). Emerging evidence suggests that these two pathological conditions can coexist.\nThe term “Sarco-osteopenia” was proposed by Binkley and Buehring in 2009 to describe a subset of frail older individuals with osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia. These individuals face a higher risk of falls, fractures, frailty, and morbidity. Later, the term evolved into “Osteosarcopenia”.\nPrevalence estimates for osteosarcopenia range from 5% to 37% among community-dwelling older individuals in various studies conducted in Japan, Iran, Germany, Australia, and China. Unfortunately, there are no published studies from India yet, specifically addressing the prevalence of this condition among the geriatric population.\nAdvancing age is a well-established risk factor for Osteosarcopenia. Other potential risk factors include malnutrition, high body fat, diabetes, depression, physical inactivity, and low educational levels. Researchers propose that short leukocyte telomere length (Kirk et al.) and intermuscular fat infiltration (Al Saedi et al.) contribute to the coexistence of Osteosarcopenia and serve as predictors of falls and fractures.\nWhy is Osteosarcopenia relevant? Without early and prompt interventions, it predisposes older individuals to falls, fractures, disability, frailty, and premature mortality. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which included 30,097 males and females aged 45-85, concluded that osteosarcopenia was associated with falls, fractures, worse life satisfaction, and limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). In 2010 alone, the European Union had 27.5 million people living with osteoporosis, resulting in approximately 3.5 million fragility fractures and a cost exceeding 37 billion euros. These numbers are projected to increase by 25% by 2025. The Hertfordshire trial estimated an annual cost of £2,707 per person, with an overall cost of £2.5 billion in 2018.\nDespite the prevalence of osteoporosis being estimated at 8-62% among Indian women, as reported in a 2023 narrative review by Agarwal et al., there is a noticeable lack of studies from India that describe the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of Osteosarcopenia. This gap in research urgently needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the development and application of accurate diagnostic methods for identifying Osteosarcopenia and predicting associated falls and fractures are of paramount importance.\nThere are no screening or risk calculation tools validated for osteosarcopenia. However, numerous tools are available to diagnose both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. SARC-F, a 5-point sarcopenia questionnaire recommended in the most recent international consensus guidelines, has limited use as a screening tool due to moderate sensitivity. However, validated tools are available for screening and risk stratification in those with osteoporosis which include the FRAX, widely used and cited.\nBone Mineral Density testing with DEXA is a specific tool for the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis. According to WHO diagnostic criteria, a t-score of -1 or less classifies the individual as having osteopenia, and -2.5 or less as osteoporosis. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Old People (EWG-SOP 2) has established cut-off points for the definitive diagnosis of sarcopenia: Appendicular Skeletal Mass Index (ASMI) &lt; 7.0 kg/m2 in males and &lt;5.5 kg/m2 in females; Muscle strength &lt; 27kgf for men and &lt;16 kgf in women. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and serum testosterone (in men) can help in detecting most secondary causes of pathology leading to falls and fractures.\nTreatment of osteosarcopenia is not well defined. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of progressive resistance and balance exercises to prevent osteosarcopenia. Whey protein, Vitamin D, and Calcium are nutritional supplements that may help in preventing osteosarcopenia. Pharmacotherapy specifically for osteosarcopenia has not yet been developed. Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, has shown promising effects on bone and muscle.\nIn summary, osteosarcopenia should be identified as a new geriatric giant of our time due to its high prevalence and vast burden of sufferers. Awareness of this condition as a geriatric syndrome should increase, and its prevention, identification, and treatment should become a priority. It should act as a unifier in a set of fragmented fields in which osteoporosis, sarcopenia, falls, and frailty are identified and managed by various specialists. Focused research in this direction could finally improve care for this silent killer.  \n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThis is called a funnel plot which is a simple scatter plot of the treatment effects (RR or OR) estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against the precision of the studies represented by standard error (SE).\nThe vertical dotted line shows the estimated combined RR or OR from the meta-analysis. The diagonal dotted lines show the range in which studies should be ideally distributed given the size (and thus precision) of each study. Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested.\n\nNow what is this?\nThis funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones.\nTwo possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.\n\nIf so, what is this?\nThe funnel plot displays the % of observed 30-day mortality rate of operations on the Y-axis and the total number of operations on the X-axis. A practice lying on the line Y=1 has a surgeon performing close to average, whereas a practice lying above Y=1 has a the total number of operations that is higher than the average.\nImportant point\nFunnel plot is used to detect publication bias as well as outliers\n\nFunnel plot\n\nFunnel plot concepts\nIt is a representation of SEM plotted against the true population mean or the no effect line of a study in a graph. Smaller studies tend to have larger SEM and the larger studies will have smaller SEM. Hence the plot assumes a funnel shape. I an ideal world, funnel plot is supposed to form a symmetrical “funnel”. This is not the case in real world, because of various reasons.\n\n\n\nUses of funnel plot\nTo identify outliers. Eg: A surgical resident’s performance\nTo identify the validity of a meta-analysis.

It is calculated by taking the square root of variance.\nStandard deviation σ = √∑, i.e., standard deviation is the square root of variance.\nAssume that someone is asked to walk on a straight line from point a to point b. The individual steps taken by the person can be equated to standard deviation and the variance is the deviation of the path from the central line.\n\nσ is the standard deviation and Σ is the variance\nUnlike standard deviation variance can identify the outliers and also shows the spread of the data.\n\n\nStandard error of mean(SEM)\n\\[\n\\sigma/\\sqrt n\n\\]\nIt is the standard deviation of the sample mean from the population mean.\nAssume that there is a population of 1000 members. In order to study the average height of the population, we have to select a sample size. Also assume that one scientist y started a study with a sample size of 50. He repeated the study for n times. He found that each time the average height found out from the study was different. He calculated the mean value of the height from these n studies and designated it as x̄1. This x̄1 is the sample mean for his study.\nAnother scientist z selected a sample size of 10 and conducted n number of similar study and similarly he also got a sample mean, x̄2. So they decided to find out the actual population mean x̄ by studying the entire population. This deviation is called Standard error of mean\nThey also calculated how far the x̄1 and x̄2 deviate from x̄.

    "text": "Perrin’s strain theory\nWhen given a chance to heal with minimal gap in between the fractured ends, bone heals by primary intention which is called primary healing. In other situations with bigger gaps in between the fractured ends, they heal by secondary intention, which is called secondary healing. This effect of gap on the fracture healing process is due to its affect on the strain which is called fracture gap strain which is given by the formula ∆FGap/FGap as described by Perrin.\n\nStrain is the deformation of a material when a given force is applied.\nFracture gap stain is the ratio of relative displacement of fracture ends versus initial fracture gap width.\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing. The strain will be less-\n\nWith large fracture area (less ∆FGap)\nMore number of fracture fragments.\nLess gap in between the fracture fragments.\n\n\nStrain and bone healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrain\nType of tissue formed\nType of healing\nStability\n\n\n\n\n100\nGranulation\n*\nAbsolute instability\n\n\n17\nFibrous tissue\n*\nUnstable\n\n\n2-10\nFibrocartilage\n20 healing\nRelative stability\n\n\n&lt;2\nLamellar bone\n10 healing\nAbsolute stability\n\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing.\n\n\nPrimary bone healing.\n\nCortical bone\nCortical bone heals by Osteonal remodeling by Osteonal cutting cones if there is no gap. This requires\n\nabsolute stability (with strain &lt; 2%)\nNo gap\nViable bone ends\n\n\nIf there is gap but &lt; 500µm, healing is by gap healing. In gap healing, osteoblast lays down sequential layers of bone to close the gap.\n\n\nCancellous bone.\nHeals primarily by a mechanism called bony ingrowth. Here revascularisation followed by osteoblasts laying down new bone.\n\n\n\nBone ingrowth in cancellous bone\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\nHam in 1930 published a description of early phases of bone healing after studying fractured rabbit fibulae and ribs. Phases of bone healing was more fully described by McKibbin in 1978. In simple terms, bone heals in 3 phases, like any other tissue.\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\n\n\n\n\nPhases of bone healing\n\nInflammation\nCellular proliferation and differentiation\nRemodeling.\n\nHowever the process is complicated by high specialisation and calcified nature of bone.\nDifferentiation of primitive mesenchymal stem cells in to cells with osteogenic potential result in a specialized connective tissue formation called callus. Ambient strain stimulate fracture gaps to form callus . For this the strain environment should be 2%-10%. Bio-mechanical function of the callus is to reduce strain by\n\nincreasing the diameter of the fractured area.\nIncreasing the stiffness.\n\n\nSoft and Hard callus.\nSoft callus: Central, due to endochondral ossification.\nHard callus: Peripheral, due to intramembranous ossification",
