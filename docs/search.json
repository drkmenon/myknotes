After medical school, I completed my residency in Orthopaedic Surgery at Government Medical College, Calicut and a fellowship in Trauma and Orthopaedics from Royal College of Surgeons, England. I am awarded FACS by American College of Surgeons in 2020. \nI have authored several web of science indexed articles and have authored and/or edited book chapter. My research interests include fracture healing and bone brain cross talk, in which I am currently persuing a PhD from KUHS.\nBeyond medicine, I am driven by a deep passion for Chess and Economics. These interests not only provide intellectual stimulation but also influence my perspectives and opinions, which may occasionally manifest on this platform.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

In other situations with bigger gaps in between the fractured ends, they heal by secondary intention, which is called secondary healing. This effect of gap on the fracture healing process is due to its affect on the strain which is called fracture gap strain which is given by the formula ∆FGap/FGap as described by Perrin.\n\nStrain is the deformation of a material when a given force is applied.\nFracture gap stain is the ratio of relative displacement of fracture ends versus initial fracture gap width.\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing. The strain will be less-\n\nWith large fracture area (less ∆FGap)\nMore number of fracture fragments.\nLess gap in between the fracture fragments.\n\n\nStrain and bone healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrain\nType of tissue formed\nType of healing\nStability\n\n\n\n\n100\nGranulation\n*\nAbsolute instability\n\n\n17\nFibrous tissue\n*\nUnstable\n\n\n2-10\nFibrocartilage\n20 healing\nRelative stability\n\n\n&lt;2\nLamellar bone\n10 healing\nAbsolute stability\n\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing.\n\n\nPrimary bone healing.\n\nCortical bone\nCortical bone heals by Osteonal remodeling by Osteonal cutting cones if there is no gap.

Here revascularisation followed by osteoblasts laying down new bone.\n\n\n\nBone ingrowth in cancellous bone\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\nHam in 1930 published a description of early phases of bone healing after studying fractured rabbit fibulae and ribs. Phases of bone healing was more fully described by McKibbin in 1978. In simple terms, bone heals in 3 phases, like any other tissue.\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\n\n\n\n\nPhases of bone healing\n\nInflammation\nCellular proliferation and differentiation\nRemodeling.\n\nHowever the process is complicated by high specialisation and calcified nature of bone.\nDifferentiation of primitive mesenchymal stem cells in to cells with osteogenic potential result in a specialized connective tissue formation called callus. Ambient strain stimulate fracture gaps to form callus . For this the strain environment should be 2%-10%. Bio-mechanical function of the callus is to reduce strain by\n\nincreasing the diameter of the fractured area.\nIncreasing the stiffness.\n\n\nSoft and Hard callus.\nSoft callus: Central, due to endochondral ossification.\nHard callus: Peripheral, due to intramembranous ossification",

An old person can lose both in a day.” — Professor Bernard Issacs\n\nThe term “geriatric giants” was coined by Professor Bernard Issacs in 1965 to describe a group of conditions: immobility, incontinence, instability, and impaired intellect. These conditions are considered “giants” due to their high prevalence and the immense burden of suffering they impose on the geriatric population, necessitating medical and social intervention. Over the years, extensive research has focused on these giants, making them a primary target for geriatricians.\nRecently, Professor Duque and colleagues from the Australian Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences identified an even larger giant: Osteosarcopenia. In a 2021 article published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging, they highlighted the twin problem of Osteosarcopenia. On one hand, it is highly prevalent, and its impact is profound. On the other hand, it has not received the equal recognition and precedence in clinical practice.\nDuring the first decade of our life, we develop a high level of independence and mobility, strongly associated with progressive increases in muscle and bone mass. However, by the third decade, this peak begins to decline. In a significant proportion of older individuals, several risk factors contribute to both Osteoporosis (decreased bone mass with micro-architectural deterioration) and Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass, strength, and function). Emerging evidence suggests that these two pathological conditions can coexist.\nThe term “Sarco-osteopenia” was proposed by Binkley and Buehring in 2009 to describe a subset of frail older individuals with osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia. These individuals face a higher risk of falls, fractures, frailty, and morbidity. Later, the term evolved into “Osteosarcopenia”.\nPrevalence estimates for osteosarcopenia range from 5% to 37% among community-dwelling older individuals in various studies conducted in Japan, Iran, Germany, Australia, and China. Unfortunately, there are no published studies from India yet, specifically addressing the prevalence of this condition among the geriatric population.\nAdvancing age is a well-established risk factor for Osteosarcopenia. Other potential risk factors include malnutrition, high body fat, diabetes, depression, physical inactivity, and low educational levels. Researchers propose that short leukocyte telomere length (Kirk et al.) and intermuscular fat infiltration (Al Saedi et al.) contribute to the coexistence of Osteosarcopenia and serve as predictors of falls and fractures.\nWhy is Osteosarcopenia relevant? Without early and prompt interventions, it predisposes older individuals to falls, fractures, disability, frailty, and premature mortality. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which included 30,097 males and females aged 45-85, concluded that osteosarcopenia was associated with falls, fractures, worse life satisfaction, and limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). In 2010 alone, the European Union had 27.5 million people living with osteoporosis, resulting in approximately 3.5 million fragility fractures and a cost exceeding 37 billion euros. These numbers are projected to increase by 25% by 2025. The Hertfordshire trial estimated an annual cost of £2,707 per person, with an overall cost of £2.5 billion in 2018.\nDespite the prevalence of osteoporosis being estimated at 8-62% among Indian women, as reported in a 2023 narrative review by Agarwal et al., there is a noticeable lack of studies from India that describe the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of Osteosarcopenia. This gap in research urgently needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the development and application of accurate diagnostic methods for identifying Osteosarcopenia and predicting associated falls and fractures are of paramount importance.\nThere are no screening or risk calculation tools validated for osteosarcopenia. However, numerous tools are available to diagnose both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. SARC-F, a 5-point sarcopenia questionnaire recommended in the most recent international consensus guidelines, has limited use as a screening tool due to moderate sensitivity. However, validated tools are available for screening and risk stratification in those with osteoporosis which include the FRAX, widely used and cited.\nBone Mineral Density testing with DEXA is a specific tool for the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis. According to WHO diagnostic criteria, a t-score of -1 or less classifies the individual as having osteopenia, and -2.5 or less as osteoporosis. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Old People (EWG-SOP 2) has established cut-off points for the definitive diagnosis of sarcopenia: Appendicular Skeletal Mass Index (ASMI) &lt; 7.0 kg/m2 in males and &lt;5.5 kg/m2 in females; Muscle strength &lt; 27kgf for men and &lt;16 kgf in women. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and serum testosterone (in men) can help in detecting most secondary causes of pathology leading to falls and fractures.\nTreatment of osteosarcopenia is not well defined. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of progressive resistance and balance exercises to prevent osteosarcopenia. Whey protein, Vitamin D, and Calcium are nutritional supplements that may help in preventing osteosarcopenia. Pharmacotherapy specifically for osteosarcopenia has not yet been developed. Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, has shown promising effects on bone and muscle.\nIn summary, osteosarcopenia should be identified as a new geriatric giant of our time due to its high prevalence and vast burden of sufferers. Awareness of this condition as a geriatric syndrome should increase, and its prevention, identification, and treatment should become a priority. It should act as a unifier in a set of fragmented fields in which osteoporosis, sarcopenia, falls, and frailty are identified and managed by various specialists. Focused research in this direction could finally improve care for this silent killer.  \n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
