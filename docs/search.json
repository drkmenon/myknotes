Hereditary: - Associations: Perthes disease, dwarfism, Stickler’s disease, tibia vara. 2.

    "text": "Perrin’s strain theory\nWhen given a chance to heal with minimal gap in between the fractured ends, bone heals by primary intention which is called primary healing. In other situations with bigger gaps in between the fractured ends, they heal by secondary intention, which is called secondary healing. This effect of gap on the fracture healing process is due to its affect on the strain which is called fracture gap strain which is given by the formula ∆FGap/FGap as described by Perrin.\n\nStrain is the deformation of a material when a given force is applied.\nFracture gap stain is the ratio of relative displacement of fracture ends versus initial fracture gap width.\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing. The strain will be less-\n\nWith large fracture area (less ∆FGap)\nMore number of fracture fragments.\nLess gap in between the fracture fragments.\n\n\nStrain and bone healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrain\nType of tissue formed\nType of healing\nStability\n\n\n\n\n100\nGranulation\n*\nAbsolute instability\n\n\n17\nFibrous tissue\n*\nUnstable\n\n\n2-10\nFibrocartilage\n20 healing\nRelative stability\n\n\n&lt;2\nLamellar bone\n10 healing\nAbsolute stability\n\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing.\n\n\nPrimary bone healing.\n\nCortical bone\nCortical bone heals by Osteonal remodeling by Osteonal cutting cones if there is no gap. This requires\n\nabsolute stability (with strain &lt; 2%)\nNo gap\nViable bone ends\n\n\nIf there is gap but &lt; 500µm, healing is by gap healing. In gap healing, osteoblast lays down sequential layers of bone to close the gap.\n\n\nCancellous bone.\nHeals primarily by a mechanism called bony ingrowth. Here revascularisation followed by osteoblasts laying down new bone.\n\n\n\nBone ingrowth in cancellous bone\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\nHam in 1930 published a description of early phases of bone healing after studying fractured rabbit fibulae and ribs. Phases of bone healing was more fully described by McKibbin in 1978. In simple terms, bone heals in 3 phases, like any other tissue.\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\n\n\n\n\nPhases of bone healing\n\nInflammation\nCellular proliferation and differentiation\nRemodeling.\n\nHowever the process is complicated by high specialisation and calcified nature of bone.\nDifferentiation of primitive mesenchymal stem cells in to cells with osteogenic potential result in a specialized connective tissue formation called callus. Ambient strain stimulate fracture gaps to form callus . For this the strain environment should be 2%-10%. Bio-mechanical function of the callus is to reduce strain by\n\nincreasing the diameter of the fractured area.\nIncreasing the stiffness.\n\n\nSoft and Hard callus.\nSoft callus: Central, due to endochondral ossification.\nHard callus: Peripheral, due to intramembranous ossification",

    "text": "Application\nEvolution of Orthopaedic training examination in UK\n\n\nThe old-style FRCS: Until late 1970s.\nMCh(Orth) from the University of Liverpool: Now obsolete\nOPTIONAL Specialty Fellowship exam in orthopaedics in 1979.\nA new intercollegiate exam was introduced in 1990, which was accepted by all four Royal Colleges.\nIn 1991 FRCS became a requirement for accreditation.\nThe four Surgical Royal Colleges (Edinburgh, England, Glasgow & Ireland) in 2015 introduced a new suite of Intercollegiate Fellowship Examinations for the international surgical community.\nThe JSCFE has parity of standard with the existing UK/Ireland Intercollegiate Fellowship. Examinations and is recognised by GMC for Speciality registration.\n\n\n\nExamination Pattern\nThe current International FRCS (Tr & Orth) exam encompasses two sections: Part I is a written exam and Part II the clinical and oral exam. For further information, and to make sure that your information is up to date, I suggest that you carefully review the Intercollegiate Speciality Board website.This is the link.\n\nPart I\nThis section consists of two separate papers ( a Computer Based Testing-CBT); essentially, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) paper (2 Hours) and an extended matching question (EMQ) paper (2 hours 30 minutes). Part I is generally regarded as the easier section of exam to pass. A number of candidates may be OK learning for an MCQ/EMI paper but be a long way off the standard for a clinical and viva exam.\nFormat of Section 1 examination changes from 2021\nThe GMC has approved an alteration to the format of the Section 1 examination. The following format is applicable to all Section 1 examinations from January 2021:\nPaper 1 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)\nPaper 2 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)\n\n\n\nHow to apply\nhttps://www.jscfe.co.uk is the official website for registering and applying for the examination. It costs £520.00 for Part I application and £1,785.00 for Part II. To apply,\n\n\nApplicants must be six years medically qualified\nApplicants would normally have passed the MRCS examination of one ofthe four Surgical Royal Colleges but this is currently not mandatory\nApplicants must have successfully completed a locally recognised surgical training programme and are required to provide evidence of having achieved the required standard of a recognised specialist (day one NHS UK/Ireland consultant standard) in the generality of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery\nThis evidence must consist of three structured references as follows:\nThe principal referee must be the applicant’s current of Head of Department or Head of the Recognised Training Committee/Programme in which the applicant has participated.\nThe second referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years\nThe third referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years\nThe final decision on eligibility for admission to the examination will lie with the Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination Specialty Board in Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery\nExamination Attempts:\nCandidates will have up to a maximum of 7 years to complete the examination process as follows:\nSection 1:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry\nSection 2:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry",

    "text": "Recommended Text books\nFrom a plethora of expensive Orthopaedic textbooks of varying size, shape and quality, it is difficult to select a perfect book or two. It is better to acknowledge the fact that the nature of the exam is diverse and there is no quick and easy remedy.\n\nMiller’s Review of Orthopaedics 7th edition.\nComing with a punchy tag line, go-to certification and recertification review guide for every orthopaedic resident, fellow, and surgeon, this book divides people in to two-Those who believe in Miller’s review and those who do not! It’s strong point is compactness and intensiveness; same is its weakness. It’s basic science, Arthroplasty and Statistics chapters are industry standard. I cleared the Part 1 studying mainly(95%) Miller and Orthobullet question bank. If allowed to grade as per FRCS Part 2 marking system, I will give 7/8 for this book when used for Part 1. Its usefulness for Part 2 as an exclusive guide is at the best doubtful. I cannot comment on the more recent 8^th edition.\n\n\nPostgraduate Orthopaedics, the candidate’s guide and Viva guide\nSelection of Part 2 book is relatively simpler. This book series stands apart. I doubt whether you can pass the Part 2 without going through these 2 books. Apart from the top class content, they drill in higher order thinking and caters to even more advanced students of orthopaedics. It is impossible to grade this book. Prof. Paul Banaszkiewicz has done a work of genius.\n\n\nDo you have any proof?\nLet’s try to learn a topic from these two books: Funnel plot\nMiller’s Review 7th edition: The topic is not covered.\n\nPostgraduate Orthopaedics:\nBoth Candidate’s guide and the viva guide beautifully discusses the funnel plot. Let me quote a few lines from them.\n\nCandidates guide\n\n“Funnel plots are used to compare outcomes in groups of different sizes. It was seen in the section on SEM that with increasing sample size the SEM approaches zero; where this does not occur it is likely that some effect is being observed. This can be used to detect ‘ outliers ’*\n\n\nIn outcome studies, such as when comparing mortality rates for different surgical centres or surgeons Inverted funnel plots can be used to detect publication bias; the SEM should be larger for studies with smaller sample sizes – If it is not this may indicate publication bias. ……….; if there is an effect of the intervention there will be a shift of the data points to the left but there should still be a greater scatter of results for the studies with a larger SEM. The plot on the left shows no such increase in scatter with increasing SEM, suggesting publication bias(two funnel plots are shown)”\n\n\n\nViva Guide\n\n“This is called a funnel plot which is a simple scatterplot of the treatment effects (RR) estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against the precision of the studies represented by standard error (SE). The vertical dotted line shows the estimated combined RR from the meta-analysis. The diagonal dotted lines show the range in which studies might be distributed by chance given the size (and thus precision) of each study. Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested. The funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones. Two possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.” You would appreciate the difference the moment you read a lesser book.\n\n\n\nConcise Orthopaedic notes\nRecently Firas Arnaout of FRCS Mentor group contacted me and suggested me to read his recently revised book, Concise Orthopaedic Notes . He kindly gave me free assess to the digital version. I thank him for the gesture, even though, as a kindle unlimited member, I had already rented and read some chapters of his book before. Authors believe that they have covered the depth and width of knowledge and skills required for the exam and challenge anyone to find an FRCS question that has not been included in the book. This book is a welcome edition and with some hard work, it can even compete with Miller’s review to some extent, for Part 1.\nLet’s see what does the book tell us about funnel plot.\n\n“Performance measuring tool used to measure variations in performance between surgeons and/or centres and identify outliers (Above red line)\nThey are scatter plots, with superimposed control limits (typically 2 SD, 3 SD or 4 SD)\nShows 90-day mortality following hip surgery\nSurgeon/hospital highlighted as orange triangle\nThe smaller the size of the sample, the wider the control limits (increased variability).\nAs the sample increases the certainty increases and the ‘funnel’ is formed.\nProgression along horizontal axis means that surgeon/hospital done more cases\nData within the control limits (between the dotted lines) are consistent with common cause variation or natural variation, whereas those outside these limits indicate unexpected good or bad results (outliers)\nFor mortality, it means they done higher risk patients\nCan’t identify someone doing very few cases (towards left side of graph) as outlier.\nProgression along vertical axis means surgeon/hospital have had more of the end point (revision or death) deaths.\nVertical axis figures presented as standardized ratio.\nFor mortality - data adjusted to take account of surgeons who operate on more higher-risk or lower-risk patients.\nSurgeons on central (green) horizontal line have had exactly average expected mortality.\nSurgeons either side of green line but below upper red line have level of mortality that is within expected range.\nSurgeons that appear above top red line have mortality rate higher than expected. This is followed by a picture of funnel plot.”\n\nAfter reading this I am more confused than confident",

    "text": "Etiology\n\nDefinition: Distal tibia epiphyseal fracture involving three planes: coronal, sagittal, and axial.\nDemographics:\n\nMore common in boys than girls due to later physeal closure.\nGirls present younger because their physis closes earlier.\n\nPhyseal Closure Order:\n\nCentral (first)\nAnteromedial\nPosteromedial\nPosterolateral\nAnterolateral (last)\n\n\nRough sequence: Posteromedial to anterolateral closure.\n\nCause: External rotational injury.\nAge Group: Adolescents (rare in children &lt;10 years or &gt;16 years).\nAssociated Injuries: 50% of cases have an associated fibula fracture.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\n\nImaging:\n\nX-rays: AP, lateral, and mortise views.\nCT Scan: Essential for surgical planning, especially to decide if surgery is required.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgical Anatomy\n\nFracture Types:\n\n2-part fracture: Most common (70%), with medial or lateral fractures. Lateral fractures are more common.\n3-part fracture: Classic “Mercedes Benz” configuration on axial CT, where a fracture line disconnects the Tillaux fragment from the posterior fragment.\n4-part fracture: Very rare.\n\nVariants:\n\nExtra-articular or intramalleolar: The articular surface is unaffected, and the sagittal fracture line exits in the medial malleolus.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement\n\nNon-Operative:\n\nIndications:\n\nExtra-articular fractures.\nDisplacement &lt;2mm.\n\nTreatment:\n\nLong leg plaster, converted to below knee after a few weeks.\n\n\n\n\nOperative:\n\nIndications:\n\nDisplacement &gt;2mm.\nJoint instability.\nIf there is &gt;2 years of growth left, consider surgery with a lower threshold.\n\nSurgical Planning:\n\nCT Scan Evaluation:\n\nAssess fragment locations.\nDetermine if it’s a 2-part or 3-part fracture.\nIdentify whether the anterior sagittal fracture is medial or lateral.\nEvaluate the Tibialis anterior tendon.\n\nSurgical Approach:\n\nAnteromedial or anterolateral, depending on where the fracture exits.\nAllows for periosteum removal, anatomical reduction, and joint assessment.\n\n\nFixation:\n\nAvoid crossing the physis unless the patient is near skeletal maturity.\nScrews: Cancellous screws, either cannulated 4mm or solid 3.5mm.\nSteps:\n\nAddress the anterior coronal fracture first (anterolateral approach).\nRemove periosteum, clear fracture site.\nReduce the posterior fragment by dorsiflexing and internally rotating the foot.\nFix the posterior fragment with an AP screw.\nAnatomically reduce the anterior epiphysis to the posterior fragment and stabilize with a screw.\n\n\nScrew Orientation:\n\nTypically anterolateral to posteromedial.\nMedial to lateral in medial 2-part fractures.\n\nPre-op CT scan is essential for planning screw placement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nBest results: Achieved with anatomical reduction.\nComplications:\n\nPost-traumatic arthrosis.\nPremature physeal arrest.\n\nLong-term Follow-up: Required to monitor complications.\n\n\n\n\nKey Visuals:\n\nMercedes Benz Sign: Seen in 3-part triplane fractures where the coronal split separates the Tillaux and posterior fragments.\nVariants: Extra-articular and intramalleolar types.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Risks increase with threaded, large, oblique pins or multiple passes.\nInterference with perichondrial ring: This ring stabilizes the physis, and disruption can destabilize it.\nPhyseal violation with implants (e.g., nails for femur fractures).\n\nSpecific Physes Susceptibility\n\nDistal femur is highly susceptible due to its wavy structure, which increases surface area, allowing fractures to cross multiple physeal parts.\n\n\n\n\nNon-Fracture Causes\n\nIrradiation\nTumors\nInfections\nCongenital disorders (e.g., Madelung’s deformity, Blount’s disease)\n\n\n\n\n\nPathophysiology of Physeal Injury & Growth Arrest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysis Zones\nCharacteristics\n\n\n\n\nHypertrophic Zone\nAvascular, poor healing potential, mostly cellular with minimal matrix\n\n\nOsseo-Cartilaginous Junction\nMetaphysis and physis are supported by the perichondrial ring of LaCroix; damage here disrupts the physis\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Arrest: Occurs in about 10% of physeal fractures, more common in Type 4 and 5 fractures.\nAdolescents: Higher likelihood of arrest due to the thickness of the physis and weaker cartilage, though with minimal remaining growth potential, impact is less significant.\n\n\nBar Formation\n\nBegins around 6 weeks post-injury but may not be clinically evident for some time.\nRequires follow-up until skeletal maturity, especially in:\n\nTypes 4 and 5 fractures.\nHigh-risk and lower limb physes due to potential impacts on leg length and mechanical alignment.\n\nBridging threshold: Damage needs to exceed 7% of physis cross-section for bridging to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of Physeal Bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPosition\nCentral, Linear, Peripheral\n\n\nSize\nCritical size is 50% of physeal area, which is the upper limit for resection; measured on axial CT or MRI for precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Ray Evaluation\n\nSigns:\n\nAngular deformity.\nVisible bar.\nAsymmetry in Harris growth recovery lines:\n\nThese sclerotic lines indicate calcification post-physeal injury.\nGrowth lines should ideally be parallel to the physis; convergence towards a bar suggests arrest.\nThe gap between growth lines and the physis shows growth since the injury. Complete arrest shows no growth lines.\n\n\nImaging:\n\nCT scan: Offers better definition of bony structures.\nMRI scan: Ideal for identifying fibrous bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors Affecting Bridge Resection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nImpact on Treatment\n\n\n\n\nAetiology\nTrauma-related bars have better outcomes than those from infections.\n\n\nPhyseal Location & Growth Contribution\nHigher growth potential enhances remodeling.\n\n\nAge & Growth Potential\nYounger children benefit more from resection; growth charts help assess potential.\n\n\nBar Size\nOptimal outcomes with bars &lt;25%; resectable up to 50%.\n\n\nBar Location\n- Peripheral: Causes angular deformity; resection recommended.  - Central: Harder to resect, causes limb length discrepancy if large.\n\n\n\nResection Criteria: 1. Child has at least 2 years or 2 cm of remaining growth. 2. Bar size &lt;25%, ideally, but maximum resection up to 50%.\n\n\n\nAlternative Treatments to Bar Resection\n\nEpiphysiodesis\n\nPrevents angular deformity in older children.\nMay include contralateral epiphysiodesis for symmetry.\n\nOsteotomy\n\nCorrects angulation; can be combined with bar resection or delayed to observe bar resection’s effect on angulation.\n\nLimb Lengthening\n\nConducted at skeletal maturity.\nOption if bar is irresectable, too large, or resection fails.\n\nDelayed Hemiepiphysiodesis\n\nPerformed opposite the bar to correct angulation once resected area shows growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nResection Technique\n\nApproach: Based on bar type and location.\n\nCentral bars often need access through osteotomy or a metaphyseal window.\nUse curettes or burrs for bar resection, with continuous irrigation.\n\nInterposition Grafts: Fill space with a fat or PMMA graft; both materials show equivalent results.\nCorrective Osteotomy: For irreparable angular deformities.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Variations of Acetabular Cups\n\nLipped Liners\n\nPurpose: Protect against instability in specific directions but may cause undesired impingement.\n\n\n\nConstrained Cups\n\nUsed When: Instability persists even after addressing all other factors (e.g., soft tissue loss).\nDisadvantages:\n\nCauses stress transfer to the cup-bone interface, which leads to premature loosening.\nNot recommended for high-demand patients or when long-term longevity is a goal.\n\n\n\n\nTantalum Cups\n\nMaterial: Trabecular metal with properties resembling trabecular bone.\nBenefits: More potential for bone ingrowth.\nChallenges: Expensive, and shearing of the coating can occur, though ideal for revision cases with minimal contact.\n\n\n\nRevision Cups\n\nJumbo Size Cups: Large hemispherical trabecular metal cups designed to fill large bony defects.\nCustom Shaped Cups: Often trabecular metal with extensions to fill cavitatory defects, or designed for protrusio deformities.\n\n\n\nAugments and Rings\n\nTrabecular Metal Augments: Secure revision cups and help fill bone defects in a customized manner.\nRings and Anti-Protrusio Cages: Used with impaction grafting to support the cup, though not biologically fixed and prone to loosening.\n\nBest Support: Placing the cage superiorly into the ileum for immediate support during graft incorporation.\n\n\n\nReferences: Canale T. “Campbell’s Operative Orthopaedics, 10th edition.” Mosby, 2002.",

    "text": "Functional Goals\n\nThe foot must be both flexible and rigid, depending on the phase of gait and activity.\nFoot and ankle joints transmit significant loads:\n\n2x body weight at rest.\n3x body weight while walking.\n13x body weight when running.\n\nThe foot needs to be a rigid lever during push-off and heel strike and supple during stance, especially on uneven ground.\n\n\n\nFoot and Ankle Movements\n\nDorsiflexion/Plantarflexion: Occur in the sagittal plane at the ankle joint.\nVarus/Valgus: Movement in the coronal plane at the hindfoot.\nAbduction/Adduction: Transverse movement of the midfoot from the midline.\nPronation/Supination:\n\nSupination: Combines ankle plantarflexion, subtalar varus, and midfoot adduction.\n\nInversion/Eversion:\n\nInversion: Combines subtalar varus and forefoot supination.\nEversion: Combines subtalar valgus and forefoot pronation.\n\n\n\n\nAnkle and Talus\n\nThe talus is wider anteriorly and moves within a 10-degree oblique axis between the malleoli.\nDuring dorsiflexion, the talus rotates externally, while during plantarflexion, it rotates internally.\nAs the foot moves, it transitions from down and in to up and out.\n\n\n\nDistal Tibiofibular Joint\n\nWell-supported by interosseous membrane (IOM) and syndesmotic ligaments, with minimal motion (2mm).\nLarge contact area typically prevents arthrosis, but if stabilizers are disturbed, rapid arthritis can develop.\n\n\n\n\nAnkle Movements During Gait\n\nAnkle provides:\n\n20 degrees of dorsiflexion (DF) and 30 degrees of plantarflexion (PF).\n11 degrees of tibial rotation (supplemented by subtalar motion for forward propulsion).\n\nGait cycle:\n\nAt heel strike, the ankle is neutral or slightly PF, followed by further PF in early stance.\nDuring mid-stance, DF occurs as the body moves over the foot, followed by PF again during push-off.\nSwing phase: Progressive DF occurs to clear the floor, followed by PF in preparation for heel strike.\n\n\n\nKinetics of the Ankle\n\nLarge contact area lowers stress compared to the hip or knee, hence less arthritis.\nSensitivity to disruptions: A 1mm taller shift can increase contact pressure by 42%, leading to early arthritis.\nGastrosoleus complex (via Achilles tendon) works to maintain upright stance, causing compressive forces on the ankle joint.\nAnkle joint reaction force is proportional to gastrosoleus activity, which explains pain during tiptoeing in osteoarthritis (OA) patients.\n\n\n\nAchilles Anatomy\n\nThe Achilles tendon spirals as it moves distally, with medial fibers inserting posteriorly and lateral fibers inserting anteriorly.\nAchilles tendon lengthening cuts should align with the fiber arrangement: Distal Anterior, Medial Proximal (DAMP procedure).\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtalar and Foot Biomechanics\n\nSubtalar joint (STJ) acts as a torque converter, translating tibial rotation into foot pronation and supination.\nSTJ provides 20 degrees inversion and 5 degrees eversion.\nAxis of rotation: In normal feet, 1 degree of tibial rotation yields 1 degree of inversion/eversion.\nVariations:\n\nFlat feet: More foot rotation due to a more horizontal subtalar axis.\nCavus feet: Less rotation due to a more vertical axis.\n\nIn the absence of subtalar motion (e.g., tarsal coalition), inversion/eversion occurs at the ankle joint.\n\n\nMidtarsal/Transverse Tarsal Motion (Chopart’s Joint)\n\nThe talonavicular (TN) joint is a ball-and-socket joint, and the calcaneocuboid (CC) joint is saddle-shaped.\nIn pronation, the joints unlock, making the foot supple.\nIn supination (e.g., during push-off), the joints lock, providing a rigid lever arm for efficient push-off.\n\n\n\nTarsometatarsal Joint Motion\n\nMovement is restricted to less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion and 15 degrees plantarflexion by strong ligaments and bony architecture.\nThe joints form the transverse arch of the midfoot, centered around the 2nd tarsometatarsal joint (Lisfranc’s joint).\n\n\n\nMetatarsal Break\n\nRefers to the oblique axis at which the metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJs) extend, varying between 50-70 degrees in individuals.\n\n\n\nPlantar Fascia\n\nOriginates at the calcaneus and inserts into the tarsal joints and proximal phalanges.\nFunctions as a truss that supports the arches and works via the windlass mechanism.\nDuring toe-off, the plantar fascia tightens, locking the tarsal joints and raising the longitudinal arch, making the foot a rigid lever.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkle Replacement Considerations\n\nFirst-Generation Implants (1970s)\n\nCemented, constrained, or unconstrained designs, prone to failure due to:\n\nCementing requiring large bone resection.\nConstrained implants loosening at the bone-implant interface.\nUnconstrained implants leading to instability due to soft tissue balancing issues.\n\n\n\n\nSecond-Generation Implants\n\nSemi-constrained designs with three components.\n\nAllow sliding in AP, mediolateral directions, and dorsi-plantar flexion.\nUncemented, reducing subsidence and loosening.\nImproved balance with thicker polyethylene inserts (fixed or mobile).\nExamples: LCS and STAR (mobile poly), Agility (fixed poly with tibiofibular fusion).\n\nIndications: OA or rheumatoid arthritis in low-demand elderly patients.\nContraindications: Infection, lack of bone stock, deformity, high demand, neuropathy, or vascular insufficiency.\nComplications: Malpositioning leading to impingement, instability, malleolar fracture, or premature wear.\n\n\n\nThird-Generation Designs\n\nIntroduce conical-shaped talar components, designed to be more anatomical. Long-term results are still pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

This section discusses the prerequisites, determinants, and abnormalities in gait, offering a comprehensive understanding of both normal and pathological gait patterns.\n\n\nPre-requisites for Normal Walking\nThere are five key prerequisites to achieve a normal walking gait, summarized by the acronym SAFE Pre-positioning:\n\nStable stance phase\n\nAdequate step distance\n\nFoot clearance during swing\n\nEnergy conservation\n\nPre-positioning of the foot in swing phase\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants of Gait\nThe following factors ensure smooth and efficient movement during walking:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPelvic tilt\nHelps smooth the gait cycle.\n\n\nPelvic lateral displacement\nMinimizes vertical oscillation.\n\n\nPelvic rotation\nIncreases stride length.\n\n\nKnee flexion\nAllows foot clearance and absorbs impact.\n\n\nAnkle and foot motion\nFacilitates propulsion and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gait Cycle\nThe gait cycle begins when the foot strikes the ground and ends when the same foot strikes again, with one cycle equal to one stride.\n\nStance Phase (60% of the gait cycle)\n\nSwing Phase (40% of the gait cycle)\n\n\nMnemonic: I Like My Tea Put In My Teapot\n\nStance Phase\n\nInitial contact (heel strike)\n\nLoading\n\nMid-stance\n\nTerminal stance\n\nPre-swing (toe-off)\n\nSwing Phase\n\nInitial swing\n\nMid-swing\n\nTerminal swing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Assessment of Gait Phases\nIn practice, clinicians focus on four primary phases:\n\nWeight acceptance\n\nInitial contact and loading\n\nStance\n\nMid-stance and terminal stance\n\nForward progression\n\nTerminal stance and pre-swing\n\nSwing\n\nIncludes all swing phases\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Gait Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDistance from one foot contact to the opposite foot contact.\n\n\nStride\nDistance from one foot contact to the same foot making contact again.\n\n\nCadence\nNumber of steps taken per unit time.\n\n\nDouble support phase\nWhen both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\n\nFloat phase\nWhen neither foot is in contact with the ground (occurs in running).\n\n\nVelocity\nStride length divided by stride time (meters/second).\n\n\nWalking base\nDistance between the heels when standing still.\n\n\nFoot progression angle\nAngle of foot direction in relation to the midline, described as positive or negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-related Gait Changes\n\n18 months – Broad-based stiff knee gait\n\n7 years – Achieves adult gait\n\nAfter 70 years:\n\nVelocity decreases\n\nStep length decreases\n\nDouble support phase increases\n\n\n\n\n\nBMI-related Gait Changes\n\nStep and stride length decreases.\n\nStance phase duration increases.\n\nIf thighs touch during walking, leg circumduction occurs to overcome friction.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Gait Analysis\nA clinical gait analysis involves inspecting the pelvis, knees, ankles, and feet during the gait cycle. Below is a summary of the normal movements seen during gait:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint\nMovement\n\n\n\n\nPelvis\nRotates anteriorly at heel strike, posteriorly at toe-off, and tilts during swing.\n\n\nHip\nFlexion aids clearance; extension prevents collapse.\n\n\nKnee\nHamstrings cushion heel strike and aid swing; quads stabilize during loading.\n\n\nAnkle\nFollows a three-rocker motion: controlled plantarflexion, dorsiflexion control, and push-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Gait Analysis\nAdvanced 3D gait analysis is particularly useful for analyzing complex gait patterns, such as those seen in cerebral palsy. This type of analysis examines:\n\nKinematics – Motion patterns\n\nKinetics – Forces required for motion\n\nPlantar pressure profiles – Weight-bearing patterns on the foot\n\nEMG – Muscle firing patterns\n\nEfficiency – Oxygen and energy consumption\n\n\n\n\nAbnormalities of Gait\nTrendelenberg Gait\n- Trunk bends laterally toward the standing leg due to weak or painful hips.\nAnterior Trunk Bending\n- Seen when patients bend forward to compensate for knee extension issues or quad weakness.\nPosterior Trunk Bending\n- Occurs due to weak hip extensors, resulting in compensatory trunk movements.\n\n\n\nPathological Gait Patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathologic Gait\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSteppage Gait\nCaused by equinus deformity.\n\n\nHip Scissoring Gait\nDue to spastic adductors.\n\n\nAntalgic Gait\nShortened stance time on a painful limb.\n\n\nQuadriceps Avoidance Gait\nSeen in ACL-deficient knees.\n\n\nShuffling Gait\nDue to weakness or fear of falling, often associated with Parkinson’s disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle Activity During Gait\nMuscle groups play specific roles throughout the gait cycle:\n\nDorsiflexors are concentric throughout the swing phase and eccentric at initial contact and loading.\nPlantarflexors are inactive during the swing phase, but eccentric in mid-stance and concentric during pre-swing (toe-off).\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Spinal Stability (White & Panjabi)\n\nDefinition: The ability of the spine to resist displacement under normal physiological loading, thus protecting neural structures from injury while preventing deformity and pain.\n\n\n\nMotion Segment\n\nA spinal motion segment includes two vertebrae and the soft tissues between them.\nStability arises from the interaction of three subsystems:\n\nPassive musculoskeletal system: Vertebrae, discs, facet joints, ligaments, and joint capsules.\nActive musculoskeletal system: The spinal muscles.\nNeural system: Proprioception and neural feedback mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive Musculoskeletal System\n\nVertebrae\n\n7 cervical (C), 12 thoracic (T), 5 lumbar (L), 5 sacral (S), 4 coccygeal vertebrae.\nVertebrae become wider and deeper as they move caudally, in response to increased loading.\nTrabeculae (vertical and horizontal) form the internal structure of vertebrae under load. Loss of trabeculae (as in osteoporosis) predisposes vertebrae to compression fractures.\nThe S-shaped spine in the sagittal plane shifts body weight away from the central axis of rotation, aiding balance and gait.\nThe axis of rotation passes through the posterior portion of the vertebral body, and spinous processes provide long lever arms for posterior muscles, resisting flexion.\n\n\n\nFacet Joints\n\nFormed between the inferior articular facet of one vertebra and the superior articular facet of the vertebra below it.\nFacet joints guide the type of movement possible between vertebrae.\nThey become progressively more vertical in the sagittal and coronal planes moving caudally.\n\nCervical spine: Resistant to translation, more susceptible to flexion/extension.\nLumbar spine: More resistant to flexion/extension.\nThoracic spine: Extra stability from the rib cage.\n\n\n\n\nSpinal Ligaments\n\nLigamentum flavum: High elastin content, preventing buckling inward. Degeneration can cause it to buckle and contribute to spinal stenosis.\nPosterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL): Resist flexion and extension forces.\nOther ligaments include intertransverse and interspinous ligaments.\n\n\n\nIntervertebral Discs\n\nShock absorbers between vertebrae that distribute load and allow limited movement. Their properties are discussed in other chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Musculoskeletal System\n\nConsists of spinal muscles, which include:\n\nExtensor muscles: Arranged in three layers (deep, intermediate, and superficial).\nAbdominal muscles: Help stabilize the spine, especially the lumbar region.\nIntercostals and lower trunk muscles: Play roles in stability and respiration.\n\nExtensor muscles:\n\nDeep muscles: Interspinalis, intertransversalis.\nIntermediate muscles: Multifidus, semispinalis (lie between the deep layer and transverse processes).\nSuperficial muscles: Erector spinae (longissimus, spinalis, iliocostalis, splenius).\n\n\n\n\n\nNeural Subsystem\n\nProprioception is critical in the spine due to its constantly changing positions and loading. It helps coordinate movement and maintain balance.\n\n\n\n\nInteraction of Subsystems in Spinal Stability\n\nSpinal range of motion is divided into two zones:\n\nNeutral zone: The initial, highly flexible range where the active and neural systems dominate, providing proprioceptive feedback to control movement.\nElastic zone: Occurs toward the end of the motion range, where the passive system limits movement and provides stability, preventing damage to neural structures.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinal Disease or Injury\n\nConditions like degenerative disc disease or burst fractures increase the size of the neutral zone beyond the normal physiological range, leading to instability.\nThe widened neutral zone increases the risk of neurological injury due to excess movement.\nIn a diseased spine, enhancing the active musculoskeletal system (i.e., muscle strengthening) can help minimize the increase in the neutral zone, restoring some stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Biomechanics of the Hand\n\nInterphalangeal (IP) Joints\n\nSingle axis hinge joints allowing flexion/extension.\nCenter of rotation (COR) is slightly anterior to the collateral ligament origin.\nStatic stability is provided by:\n\nBony architecture (similar to the knee joint)\nCollateral ligaments\nVolar plate\n\n\n\n\nMetacarpophalangeal (MP) Joints\n\nThese joints have two axes of movement: flexion/extension and abduction/adduction.\nAbduction/adduction only occurs when the proximal phalanx (P1) is flexed to 30 degrees.\nThis leads to circumduction around the metacarpal head.\nStatic stability components are the same as in IP joints (bony structure, collateral ligaments, volar plate).\n\n\n\nCarpometacarpal (CMC) Joints of the Fingers\n\nUlnarward movement restricts mobility progressively, with the 4th and 5th CMC joints being highly rigid, transmitting forces from hand to wrist.\nThe third metacarpal (MC) acts as a cantilever to support flexor sheaths, and the fibrous framework includes collateral ligaments and transverse metacarpal ligaments.\n\n\n\nThumb CMC Joint\n\nA saddle joint with two axes of movement similar to the MP joints of the fingers.\nCircumduction is a consequence of the two axes of movement when the thumb metacarpal is slightly flexed.\nTrapezium and metacarpal base have differing radii of curvature, allowing thumb pronation and increased range of motion, though at the expense of stability.\nStability comes from the volar oblique (beak) ligament and the capsule, but this ligament is prone to rupture, leading to joint instability. It can be repaired or reconstructed with a trapeziectomy if needed.\nLoading of the thumb CMCJ can reach up to 120 kg, with most force transmitted through the volar half, making the volar oblique ligament particularly vulnerable to attenuation or rupture.\nThe thumb CMCJ and MPJ work in unison, as motor tendons cross both joints.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor Systems and Tendon Excursion\n\nThe hand’s movement is powered by flexors, extensors, and intrinsic muscles.\nTendon excursion lengths:\n\nFlexor and extensor tendons: 30-50-70 mm.\nWrist flexors and extensors: 30 mm.\n\n\n\nExtensor Mechanism\n\nComposed of long extensors (extrinsics) and intrinsic muscles.\nThe extensor hood is made up of:\n\nLong extensor tendons\nLumbricals (on the radial side)\nInterossei\n\nLateral bands control the distal phalanx, and the central slip controls the middle phalanx.\n\n\n\nFlexor Mechanism\n\nFlexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) is a mass-action muscle with some independent action in the index finger.\nThe quadrigia effect occurs when shortening or tethering of one FDP tendon causes slight flexion in the other DIP joints.\nTension in the FDP is constant during contraction, with greater torque proximally because the moment arm between the MPJ COR and DIPJ COR is longer at the MPJ. Thus, higher torque is generated at the MPJ even for small loads.\nAnnular pulleys (A1-4) prevent bowstringing and maintain tendon proximity to the COR of each joint, maximizing power. A2 and A4 are the most important.\nCruciate pulleys (C1-3) lie between annular pulleys, supporting tendon sheaths.\nThe flexor retinaculum also acts as a pulley.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrinsic Muscles\n\nLumbricals\n\nUnique muscles: they originate from the FDP tendons and insert into the extensor hood.\nLumbricals fine-tune the tension between the flexor and extensor systems.\n\n\n\nInterossei\n\nPalmar interossei adduct the fingers, while dorsal interossei abduct them.\nBoth types arise from the metacarpal shafts and contribute to the extensor hood.\n\n\n\nCombined Function of Intrinsics\n\nTogether, the intrinsics flex the MPJ and extend the PIPJ, with the lumbricals playing a larger role due to their distance from the MPJ COR, which gives them a longer moment arm.\nIntrinsics allow the fingers to flex without curling, which is essential for grasping large objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Conditions of Intrinsic Muscle Imbalance\n\nIntrinsic paralysis leads to the intrinsic-minus hand, characterized by hyperextension of the MPJ due to the long extensors and a flexed posture of the DIPJ and PIPJ due to long flexor tension, creating a claw-hand deformity.\n\nGrasping is impossible in this condition, and fingers curl into a fist from the distal (FDP) to proximal (FDS) tendons.\n\nIntrinsic-plus hand is the opposite, due to intrinsic tightness. The MPJs are flexed, and the PIPJs extended.\nLumbrical paradox: Because the lumbricals bridge between the long flexors and extensors, paradoxical PIPJ extension can occur when attempting to flex the fingers.\nLumbrical-plus finger: An extreme example of this paradox, where FDS is sectioned distal to the lumbrical origin. All FDS power is transmitted via the lumbrical to the long extensors, causing PIPJ hyperextension when the FDS contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "What is weight?\nWeight is the force exerted by gravity on an object, calculated using the formula: Weight = Mass x Gravity. In this equation, mass is measured in kilograms (kg), gravity in meters per second squared (m/s²), and the resulting force, or weight, is in newtons (N). For instance, a person with a mass of 70 kg would have a weight of approximately 700 N (assuming gravity is 10 m/s² for simplicity).\n\nMoment\n\nThe effect of a force acting at a given distance perpendicular to a body is known as a moment. It is calculated as Moment = Force x Perpendicular Distance. When a force is applied at a distance from a pivot point, it causes the segment to rotate, resulting in rotational or angular movement. The distance from the pivot to the point where the force is applied is called the moment arm, and the rotational effect produced is referred to as the turning moment. The turning moment, also called torque, is expressed as Turning Moment = Force x Moment Arm or F x d = Torque, representing the magnitude of rotational force.\n\n\nCouples\nA pair of forces acting to create the same moment\ne.g. opening a bottle cap with two fingers",

Characteristics\n\nProkaryotic: Bacteria have no nucleus.\nNo mitochondria or lysosomes.\nThey do have a cell wall.\n\n\n\nGram Staining\n\nBased on the ability of bacterial cell walls to retain stains.\n\nGram-positive bacteria: Retain blue stain (crystal violet idium).\nGram-negative bacteria: Retain pink stain (safranin).\n\n\n\n\nBacterial Shapes\n\nCocci: Spherical bacteria.\nBacilli:

until the wound is closed or up to 72 hours max.\nIf using Cefuroxime, add Gentamicin during debridement.\nFor penicillin-allergic patients, use Clindamycin 600mg QDS.\nIn gross contamination, consider adding Metronidazole.\n\n\n\nChronic Infection\n\nCommonly caused by Staphylococcus Aureus or Staphylococcus Epidermidis in hardware-related cases.\nBiofilm and glycocalyx formation require antibiotics with good bone penetration.\nClindamycin is recommended for osteomyelitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotic Resistance\n\nModes of Resistance\n\nIntrinsic Resistance:\n\nDue to structural or

Calcium then binds to troponin, causing a conformational change in tropomyosin.\nThis change exposes binding sites on actin, allowing myosin heads to attach and form cross-bridges, a process that requires ATP.\nDuring contraction, the sarcomere shortens.

They primarily consist of type I collagen, with some type III collagen and elastin. Fibroblasts are the main cellular component.\nLigaments connect bone to bone and are covered by epiligament. They also contain type I collagen but have more elastin and less uniform fiber orientation than tendons.",

During inflammation, a hematoma forms and inflammatory cells are recruited. Fibroblasts then proliferate and begin collagen deposition, forming a fibrous bridge by the second week. Remodeling involves consolidation and maturation of collagen fibers.\nAfter surgical repair, tendons are weakest at one week, gain strength significantly by four weeks, and reach near-normal strength by six months.",

Appositional Ossification\n\nFunction:\nThis process is responsible for the increase in width of bones.\nProcess:\n\nOsteoblasts align along the bone surface and lay down the bone matrix.\n\nExamples:\n\nPeriosteal bone formation: Occurs on the external surface of bones.\nFracture healing in children.\nBone remodeling: As per Wolff’s law, which states that bone adapts to mechanical stress, new bone is laid down on the concave aspect of a deformity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Key Components of a Nerve\nNeuron: - The fundamental unit of a nerve. - Consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites.\nCell Body: - Gives rise to axons and dendrites.\nDendrites: - Thin sensory processes that receive input from other neurons.\nAxon: - The main route for conducting signals to tissues. - Axon size: 0.2 to 20 μm.\nGlial Cells: - Support neurons and form the myelin sheath. - CNS Glial Cells: Oligodendrocytes (myelin production), astrocytes, and microglia. - PNS Glial Cells: Schwann cells.\nMyelination: - Myelinated Axons: One Schwann cell per axon internode. - Unmyelinated Axons: Bundled together with no myelin (Remak Bundle).\nMyelin: - A lipid and protein-rich sheath laid down in the PNS, forming the neurilemma (not present in CNS myelinated axons).\nNodes of Ranvier: - Gaps between Schwann cells, essential for saltatory conduction.\n\n\n\nNerve Structure\n\nAxons group to form nerve fibres.\nFibres group to form bundles.\nBundles group to form fascicles.\nFascicles group to form a nerve trunk.\n\nLayers of a Nerve: 1. Endoneurium: Surrounds grouped axons (nerve fibres), contains collagen and blood vessels. 2. Perineurium: Surrounds fascicles, prevents excessive diffusion and oedema. 3. Epineurium: A dense collagen layer that surrounds groups of fascicles, forming a supportive sheath with blood vessels.\n\n\n\nBlood Supply to Nerves\nNerves receive blood through intrinsic and extrinsic plexuses: - Extrinsic Plexuses: Segmental vessels in the epineurium. - Intrinsic Plexuses: Longitudinal vessels, mainly in the endoneurium, with a blood-nerve barrier.\n\n\n\nBiomechanics of Nerves\n\nNerves exhibit viscoelastic properties.\nSusceptible to traction injuries; ischemia occurs at 15% strain, rupture at around 20%.\nNerves rely on ATP-dependent transport, making them vulnerable to ischemia, anoxia, and hypothermia.\n\n\n\n\nAction Potentials\n\nThe axon’s resting membrane potential is -70mV, maintained by Na+ and K+ channels.\nAction potential involves the opening of Na+ channels, followed by K+ channels, creating electrical currents essential for nerve function.\n\nNodes of Ranvier play a crucial role in saltatory conduction, allowing faster signal transmission with less energy consumption.\n\n\n\nSynapse and Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)\n\nThe NMJ is where the nerve communicates with muscle fibres.\nNeurotransmitters like acetylcholine are released into the synaptic cleft, passing on the action potential.\nResidual neurotransmitters are metabolised and removed from the cleft.\n\n\n\n\nEmbryology of the Nervous System\nThe nervous system arises from the ectoderm (one of the three germ layers). The neural tube forms the CNS and motor neurons, while the neural crest forms sensory neurons, the PNS, and basal ganglia.\n\n\n\nOrganisation of the Nervous System\n\nCNS: Includes 12 paired cranial nerves and 31 paired spinal nerves.\n\nSpinal nerves divide into dorsal (sensory) rami and ventral (motor) rami.\n\nSensory Nerve Receptors:\n\nMechanoreceptors (e.g., Meissner, Pacinian corpuscles),\nThermoreceptors (temperature),\nNociceptors (pain).\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomic Nervous System\nThe autonomic nerves originate from the grey matter of the spinal cord (T1 to L2 levels). They synapse in the paravertebral ganglia before relaying signals to viscera or traveling along the sympathetic trunk.\n\n\n\nNerve Fibre Types\n\n\n\nFibre Type\nExample\nMyelination\nDiameter (µm)\nVelocity (m/s)\n\n\n\n\nAα\nMotor (large diameter)\nMyelinated\n20\n100\n\n\nAβ\nOrganised sensory (hair)\nMyelinated\n10\n50\n\n\nAδ\nPain & Temperature\nMyelinated\n5\n25\n\n\nB\nAutonomic Pre-Ganglionic\nMyelinated\n5\n10\n\n\nC\nAutonomic Post-ganglionic, Slow Pain\nUnmyelinated\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeripheral Nerve Injury\nPeripheral nerve injuries may result from crush, traction, laceration, or compression. Their classification involves histological analysis and time to assess the severity:\n\nSeddon Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nFeatures\nSunderland Grade\nPrognosis\n\n\n\n\nNeuropraxia\nNo Wallerian degeneration, conduction block\nGrade 1\nGood\n\n\nAxonotmesis\nWallerian degeneration, axonal damage\nGrade 2-4\nModerate\n\n\nNeurotmesis\nComplete nerve transection\nGrade 5\nPoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathology of Nerve Injury\nIn Wallerian degeneration, both the proximal and distal parts of the axon undergo significant changes. The proximal axon undergoes atrophy, while the distal part degenerates completely. Schwann cells assist in regeneration, with regrowth occurring at 1mm per day.\n\n\n\nMotor End Plate\nThe motor end plate plays a crucial role in muscle innervation. Over time, without re-innervation, the motor end plate degenerates, followed by muscle spindle degradation.\nRecovery Order of Sensory Nerves: 1. Pressure sense 2. Protective pain 3. Moving touch 4. 2-point discrimination 5. Normal sensation\n\n\n\nFactors Affecting Nerve Recovery\n\nPatient Factors: Age.\nInjury Factors: High energy, associated vascular injury, crush or traction injury.\nSurgical Factors: Delay in repair, infection, repair under tension.\n\n\n\n\nManagement Principles\n\nNon-operative Treatment:\n\nFor neuropraxia and most axonotmesis injuries.\n\n\n\nSurgical Repair:\n\nPerformed in clean, vascularised beds with stable skeletal structures. Nerve grafting may be needed for gaps. Autografts (sural nerve) or conduits can be used for reconstruction.\n\n\n\nOutcomes:\n\nDepend on factors such as patient age, injury location, and surgical timing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Orthopaedic Metallurgy\n\nMolecular Structure of Metals\n\nMetals consist of crystalline structures made up of millions of crystalline grains, which contain molecular lattices.\nThree types of defects can affect the mechanical properties of bulk metal:\n\nGrain Boundaries: Connections between adjacent crystals; they limit crack and dislocation propagation but are sites of weakness.\nDislocations: Defects within individual crystals where the 2-D lattice stops abruptly; under stress, these dislocations propagate, leading to plastic deformation.\nCracks: Volumetric voids within individual crystals that can significantly impact mechanical properties.\n\nManufacturing processes and post-manufacture quality control aim to manage these defects to create metals with desired properties.\n\n\n\nAlloys\n\nAlloys are combinations of elemental metals that improve mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, or biocompatibility compared to their individual components.\nDuctility can be reduced by:\n\nAdding large metal ions that prevent lattice layers from slipping.\nAdding small ions (e.g., carbon) that fill gaps between lattices and hinder slipping.\n\nAdding carbon to steel increases brittleness, hence low-carbon steel is preferred for implants.\n\n\n\nAddition of Other Elements\n\nNickel & Chromium: Increase corrosion resistance.\nCobalt & Molybdenum: Enhance material strength.\n\n\n\nManufacture of Metals\n\nMachining: Final finishing process using lathes or mills.\nCasting: Molten metal is poured into a mold and allowed to cool. Grain size affects properties:\n\nRapid cooling yields smaller grains (harder but more brittle).\nSlow cooling produces larger grains (more ductile).\nNot commonly used in orthopaedics due to control difficulties.\n\nForging: Most common method for implant manufacture.\n\nApplies pressure to shape metal, aligning grain boundaries and improving mechanical properties.\nCan be done through:\n\nCold Working: Room temperature, increases strength but reduces ductility and increases brittleness.\nHot Working: Above crystallization temperature, easier to shape, maintains ductility, and can be hardened later.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat Treatments\n\nAnnealing: Heats metal above crystallization temperature to alter dislocation patterns and grain boundaries, followed by controlled cooling to improve ductility and workability.\nQuenching: Sudden immersion in cold water to trap impurities and harden the material.\nTempering: Re-heating to lower temperatures after quenching to reduce brittleness.\n\n\n\nCoatings and Surface Finishes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish\nProcess\nRoughness (µm)\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\nPolished\nMechanical abrasion\n0.1\nAny\n\n\nMatte\nMechanical abrasion\n0.8\nAny\n\n\nGrit Blasted\nMechanical abrasion\n3\nAny\n\n\nSintered Beads\nSintering\n150\nCoCr\n\n\nPlasma Spray\nPlasma spraying\n50-150\nHA, Tantalum\n\n\nPorous Metals\nVapour deposition\n150-250\nTantalum\n\n\n\n\nGrit Blasting: Uses hard metallic crystals to give a rough finish for better cement interdigitation.\nSintered Beads: Increase surface roughness by applying heated metal beads, often CoCr, to implants.\nPlasma Spray Coating: Uses high-temperature torches to heat coating material into plasma, which is then sprayed onto implants.\n\n\n\nCommon Orthopaedic Metals\nAn ideal orthopaedic material should be fatigue resistant, biocompatible, resistant to corrosion, and sufficiently strong, ductile, and stiff.\n\n316L Stainless Steel\n\nComposition: 60% Iron, 20% Chromium, 3% Molybdenum, 16% Nickel, 0.03% Carbon.\nMechanical Properties:\n\nGood fatigue resistance and relatively biocompatible.\nHigh stiffness and hardness, ductility allows contouring of plates.\nSusceptible to galvanic corrosion and nickel hypersensitivity.\n\n\nTitanium 64 (Ti-6Al-4V)\n\nComposition: 90% Titanium, 6% Aluminium, 4% Vanadium.\nMechanical Properties:\n\nLess stiff than CoCr and steel, good fatigue resistance.\nLow surface hardness and highly notch-sensitive.\nExcellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility.\nMRI and CT safe with minimal image distortion.\n\n\nCobalt Chrome (CoCr 60255)\n\nComposition: 60% Cobalt, 25% Chromium, 5% Molybdenum, 10% other.\nMechanical Properties:\n\nHigh modulus of elasticity and stiffness.\nGood fatigue strength and ultimate tensile strength.\nLow surface roughness and relatively corrosion-resistant.\nUsed as articulating components but can lead to ion dissemination and metal hypersensitivity.\n\n\nTantalum\n\nComposition: Pure Tantalum.\nMechanical Properties:\n\nLow modulus of elasticity similar to cancellous bone.\nHigh porosity (up to 80%) allowing for rapid bone ingrowth.\nNot suitable for stems due to lower strength and fatigue resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Material Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nTi-6Al-4V\nCo-Cr-Mo\n316L Stainless Steel\nTantalum\n\n\n\n\nModulus of Elasticity (GPa)\n106–115\n210\n230\n2.5–3.9\n\n\nYield Strength (MPa)\n860\n825\n170–690\n35–51\n\n\nUltimate Strength (MPa)\n780–1050\n430–1028\n515–860\n50–110\n\n\nToughness (J/m³)\n75 (MPa m½)\n-\n88–134\n-\n\n\nHardness (Rockwell C)\n36\n42\n60\n-\n\n\nFatigue Strength (MPa at 10⁷ cycles)\n480–590\n310\n180–300\n18–20\n\n\nMass Density (g/cc)\n4.4\n8.3\n8.0\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Risk and pay-off graph\nAssume that we have a pay-off, g, which is a convex function of risk, x, given by f(x)=g.\nLet us plot risk, x, in x axis and pay-off, g, in y axis. When we go to the right in the x axis, risk goes on increasing and at one point x2, risk is 100%. We can loose everything deployed. Yet the reward is exponentially high to ignore,1000%!. In the extreme left, x1 , we can deploy the same asset with zero risk to get a modest return of 9%. Let the probability of x1 be p1 and probability of x2 be p2. p1 is extremely likely event and p2 is less likely event, and they can be unrelated. But for simplicity, p1 is around 66% and p2 is around 33% ( assuming that x2 happens when ever market moves more than 10% in either directions in 6 months). The below diagram graphically depicts the above mentioned scenario.\n\n\n\nJensen’s inequality\n\n\nIf all assets are deployed at x1, we can generate a return of f(E(x1))=9% with very high probability of success with almost zero risk. On the other hand, if we deploy all the assets at x2, we may generate a mind blowing return of f(E(x2))=1000%, but with a very high probability of 100% capital loss.\nAssume we have a combination of x1 and x2. Here, Jensen’s inequality says that expected value of g will always be greater than or equal to the function of the expected value of x, given that the f(x) is convex\n\\[\nE(g) &gt;= f(E(x))\n\\]\n\nConclusion\n\nNever put all eggs in one basket of similar risk-pay-off profile.\n\nOur immediate hunch will be to distribute the asset in all possible values of x to get an expected pay-off which is greater than the sum of the individual returns. This is true for a single period return.\nProblem with this is, when we invest for multiple periods without rebalancing, the approach neglect the following facts:\n\nthe money weighted moral expectation (geometric mean) is the true pay-off or return.\nThe correlation between various asset classes play a major role in determining the final return.\n\nBecause most asset classes which are originally negatively correlated become positively correlated during a draw-down, diversification reduces the geometric mean to mediocre levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIn other words, for multiple period investment, the true return is not the arithmetic mean, it is the geometric mean of money weighted return on capital. Diversification reduces the downside risk, but with a bad side effect of reducing the upside risk.\n\n\nThen, what should be our strategy?\nFor multiple period time horizon, it is impossible to predict the future return. What we can do is try to domesticate uncertainty by limiting the downside risk to minimum fixed value while keeping all the upside risks untouched.\nIn short, what we should try for is diversification in time using asset classes that can capture unlimited upside risk and at the same time limit any downside risk to fixed quantity, not diversification of assets.",

    "text": "probability of tiger attack-definition of market-tax you pay unknowingly-falling down the logarithmic curve- Sharpe can make you poor-never lose the principal\nIf I am a resident of a forest famous for man eating tiger, only thing that matters is that knowledge-there are tiger out there; not the probability of tiger attacking me nor their number. That holds true even when I am on a half day visit to the forest, not necessary having applied for a residency there.\nOnce again, what really matters is “are there any tiger out there?”, not “when she will come?”, “how many tigers are out there?” nor “how often they attack men?” Market can be likened to a forest. Just as you might encounter a man-eating tiger in the forest, draw-downs in the market can be equally dangerous for your portfolio. But you also often get pleasantly surprised with delicious fruits—great returns. Above all, the market, like the forest, is unpredictable.\nLong back, one of my collogues asked me to explain market and predict what will happen when. I told him,\n“Market is what market does: It fluctuates”\nMarket fluctuates; it fluctuates violently in either directions; it fluctuates violently in either directions stochastically; it fluctuates violently in either directions stochastically with periods of stochastic quiescence in between. We can never know when it will fluctuate, how many times it will fluctuate, in what direction and sequence it will fluctuate.\nWe always welcome upward movement. We want market to move upward more frequently and more violently. Problem is that market can also move down and it often does. Below is the 5 year annual return of Nifty 50 index:\n\n\n\nYear\nReturn\n\n\n\n\n2007\n+54%\n\n\n2008\n-52%\n\n\n2009\n+76%\n\n\n2010\n+18%\n\n\n2011\n-25%\n\n\n\nWe can evaluate the returns for this period either using arithmetic mean or CAGR. Arithmetic average return during the period is 14.2% (annual), but the CAGR is just 2.86%. Arithmetic average does not really matter, what really matters is the CAGR. It determines your final TPV (total Portfolio Value), if you have lump-sum investment at the starting period. It is what you have realised.\nIf we can magically remove the 2 big draw-downs to zero, the CAGR becomes 26.2%!!. 23.32 is the volatility tax you paid unknowing during the period. Volatility tax eats from your principal.\nIf you lose 1% of the principal, to get back to 100%, you need 1% return. If it is 5% lose, you need little more than 5% to recover. This increases exponentially when the lose increases, by the formula:\n\\[\n(x/(100-x))100\n\\]\nIt is just like walking towards the crest of the water fall. Instead of waterfall, here you fall down from the crest of logarithmic curve.\n\n\n\n\nLoss\nReturn need to reset\n\n\n\n\n1%\n1%\n\n\n5%\n5.3\n\n\n10%\n11.1%\n\n\n20%\n25%\n\n\n40%\n66.67%\n\n\n50%\n100%\n\n\n75%\n300%\n\n\n95%\n1900%\n\n\n100%\n∞\n\n\n\nModern portfolio theory attempts to address the problem of volatility through diversification and proposes the Sharpe ratio to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio. It reduces downward volatility to some extent, but in doing so, it also reduces favorable upward movements, prescribing a cure that may be costlier than the disease—ultimately leaving you in a zoo instead of a grand forest, out of fear.\nThis takes us back to the fundamental law of investment: Never lose the principal. Try to achieve this without reducing the overall return, as you might otherwise end up poorer.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

He found that each time the average height found out from the study was different. He calculated the mean value of the height from these n studies and designated it as x̄1. This x̄1 is the sample mean for his study.\nAnother scientist z selected a sample size of 10 and conducted n number of similar study and similarly he also got a sample mean, x̄2. So they decided to find out the actual population mean x̄ by studying the entire population.

There are 49 rows, curresponding 49 students and 18 variable columns. It include an identifier for each student. The type of class is in the “character” class, which we want as “factor”, because it should be the grouping variable.

Discoveries of Science do not seem to take us towards any ultimate truth. The very foundation of science,i.e., Falsification, presupposes the absence of any ultimate truth.

Expertise has become superspecialized and technological in its nature, so students have to learn clinical skills from scores of teachers. As attachments have become more numerous, they have become shorter and the number of learners has increased, so education has become less personal. Traditional bedside teaching skills have decayed as each generation is less exposed to them.New educational technologies such as skills training and problem-based learning have brought education within the control of the objective-driven curriculum by substituting simulation for reality. All that sounds depressingly like the curriculum ‘without the personal influence of [clinical] teachers upon pupils’ that Osler likened to an Arctic winter.\nThis is bewildering for any medical teacher worth his salt.\nTwo classic papers that help us to trace the roots of this situation and the potential vaccine for it (the Early Clinical Exposure) are those written by Tim Dornam FRCP and Okay Basak et al",

He thoroughly analyses the contributions of these two giants and suggested that the wheel has come full circle. Osler introduced a clerkship system that gave students a role in the clinical service.\n\nDisease, in his view, was the student’s chief teacher, and teaching should be at the bedside rather than in the lecture hall. Teaching away from the bedside was a ‘bastard substitute.’",

They’re primarily written for myself, serving as a single point for my quick reference (My collected notes in Orthopaedics 🌳). Some, I’ve decided to share publicly out of curiosity 🤟(My baby steps in research)\nIf something feels unclear or under explained, it’s likely because these notes weren’t originally intended for an external audience. That’s part of the original idea 🌻 (Write notes for yourself first, without prioritizing external readers).\nThere is an organized index and navigation system for the notes to bring in some sanity.

His parents recognized his talent early and made significant sacrifices to nurture his passion for chess. At one time, as Gukesh told after the press conference today, they even borrowed money to support him. Today, he stands as one of the brightest stars in the chess world. He led India to Olympic gold this year and became the youngest player ever to both challenge for and win the World Chess Championship.\nBelow is an interview of Gukesh years back when he was a kid.

Recognizing his talent, they made countless sacrifices to provide him with the best possible opportunities.\nHis historic unbeaten streak of 100 games between 2017 and 2018 took him to above 2800 Elo rating, a milestone reached by only 14 players in the history of chess. In 2023, he became the World Chess Champion.\nKnow more about Ding",

He almost always appeared calm and composed under high-pressure situations, a demeanor that an alien like Magnus Carlsen might not enjoy. He always wanted to play, trying to create chances even with inferior positions. While pundits were giving him a 0.27% chance of winning, he played on. In that way, he created his own luck at one point and seized it with all hands. After the shocking win, although he almost completely broke down, he quickly regained his composure, stoically rearranged the chess pieces, thanked the chess set, and put the chair back in its position. This speaks volumes about this young talent. As Hikaru Nakamura said on his stream, Gukesh has just begun—there’s only upside to see in his future.\nHe didn’t forget to take a light jab at Magnus, the GOAT, during the press conference:\n\n\nThe title he took away from Chennai is taken back.

    "text": "Low-Volume Sprint Interval Training (SIT)\nLow-volume Sprint Interval Training (SIT), which can be cosidered a subset of HIIT,involves:\n\nVery High-Intensity Intervals: Work intervals lasting approximately 30 seconds.\nShort Duration: Each bout of activity is brief but intense.\nLong Recovery Periods: Rest intervals lasting around 4 minutes between each bout.\n\n\nBenefits of SIT\nStudies suggest that SIT can produce improvements in:\n\nAerobic Power: Comparable to traditional endurance training.\nMetabolic Function: Enhances energy efficiency and metabolic health.\n\nSIT provides an efficient alternative to traditional endurance training while maintaining similar physiological benefits. SIT has garnered considerable attention as a time-efficient and alternative method for enhancing aerobic performance and metabolic function(Sloth et al. 2013).\n\n\nDefinition\n\nDuration of Bouts: 10–30 seconds\nIntensity: Maximal effort, “all-out”\nVolume: ≤12 repetitions\nRecovery: ≥5 times the duration of each work bout\n\nSprint Interval Training (SIT) involves specific criteria to optimize its effectiveness. Bout durations are set between 10 and 30 seconds. Durations shorter than 10 seconds are excluded as they rely predominantly on anaerobic metabolism and have shown no significant impact on mitochondrial enzymes(M.-T. Linossier et al. 1993);(M.-T. Linossier et al. 1997);(BOGDANIS et al. 1998);(Dawson et al. 1998). The upper limit of 30 seconds is based on evidence that longer bouts significantly increase aerobic contribution to ATP turnover(Withers et al. 1991) and lead to a marked reduction in intensity, which disqualifies them from being classified as low-volume SIT. Intensity is characterized as “all-out” or near-maximal effort, adhering to the general conception of a sprint(Ross and Leveritt 2001). Volume and recovery protocols are designed to maintain a low total training volume while ensuring that high power output can be sustained across all sprints within a session.",

    "text": "Bumpy roads to who knows where\nThis reticulate evolution sometimes reaches a saturation point as far as a particular individual entity (e.g., cells) is concerned. What may mean by a saturation point is that HGT breaks the existing composition, and a new entity emerges from the existing one. Very often, such an entity will not have any survival advantage and becomes obsolete over the passage of time.\nBut, as Freeman Dyson would call it, a ‘Bill Gates’ moment can happen at this juncture. The entity or cell that gains a new emergent property, a saltation, suddenly feels it inconceivable to share that property with the rest of the community. The advancement thus happened gets reserved to the private consumption rather than the advancement of the community. Muliple such events might have happened.\nThese saltatory moments become the start of a winner-takes-all, fractal cascade, the vertical individual evolution. This vertical wrinkle in the vast sea of horizontal evolution is marked by canonical interactions based on competition for survival rather than free transfer.\nThat wrinkle could be archaea, bacteria, a eukaryote, or even an unknown entity that could be evolving vertically in their own right. What is clear here is that vertical evolution is not only bumpy or staccato, but it seemingly leads to nowhere.",

It claims to provide a sandboxed environment where applications can run independently from the rest of the system.

Since death is inevitable, prevention efforts aim to compress morbidity—reducing the duration and severity of illness and disability—toward the very end of life. This approach seeks to minimize the time individuals spend suffering from disease before passing, thereby improving overall well-being during ageing(Harrison’s principles of internal medicine 2022).\nOne of the key development in this direction is primordial prevention, prevention of the development of risk factors for disease, not just prevention of disease.Naturally, emphasize is on upstream determinants of risk for chronic diseases, such as eating patterns, physical activity, and environmental and social determinants of health.\nIf we have to know more about basic questions like what to eat and what sort of physical activity promote long term health and longevity, we should start with the basic science.\nNutrition has a profound effect on ageing in all species. One of the most important nutritional interventions that influences ageing is caloric restriction (CR). Hence the focus is on nutrient sensing pathways. Key pathways are\nThe mTORC1 (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathways are central regulators of cellular metabolism, growth, proliferation and longevity. Their interaction is critical, as their dysregulation contributes to conditions such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation, and tumor progression.\nRecent findings reveal that the interaction between these pathways is bidirectional. mTORC1 directly suppresses AMPK signalling,limiting AMPK’s ability to respond to metabolic stress. AMPK indirectly inhibits mTORC1. This reciprocal regulation highlights a complex feedback mechanism that maintains cellular homeostasis under varying conditions of energy availability and stress. This interplay underscores the importance of understanding mTORC1 and AMPK regulation both in health and disease(Ling et al. 2020).\nflowchart TD\n\nA{Aerobic exercise&lt;br/&gt;Starvation&lt;br/&gt;Muscle contraction} --&gt; B[SIRT1]\nA --&gt; C[Central Ghrelin]\nA --&gt; D[reduced Insulin]\nB --&gt; E{Upregulate AMPK}\nC --&gt; E\nD --&gt; E\nE --&gt; F[Increase Life span]\nG[Animal Protein&lt;br/&gt;Muscle strengthening] --&gt; H[mTOR activation]\nH --&gt; I[Increased muscle mass & strength]\nE &lt;--&gt; J(INHIBIT)\nJ &lt;--&gt; H\nAMP kinase is believed to be the central switch that positively regulate the life span of an individual(Jeon 2016).\nIt is regulated by a complex mechanism:",

    "section": "The Theory of Training Super-compensation",
    "text": "The Theory of Training Super-compensation\nSystematic training is designed to enhance the fitness level of individuals. One foundational concept in training theory is the training super-compensation cycle, introduced by Yakovlev(Issurin 2010). This theory explains how the human body reacts and adapts to physical loads from training sessions or periods, leading to improved performance over time.\n\nPhases of the Supercompensation Cycle\n\nStress and Fatigue:\n\nTraining imposes physical loads that the body is unaccustomed to, causing stress and fatigue.\nThis results in an acute reduction in performance and work capability, marking the initial phase of the cycle.\nThe body perceives this as an emergency and prioritizes recovery.\n\nRecovery:\n\nAfter the training session, the body begins an intense recovery process.\nThis leads to the restoration of physical performance and work capability to pre-training levels.\n\nSupercompensation:\n\nBeyond recovery, the body continues to adapt in response to the prior training stimulus.\nPerformance and work capability increase, allowing for improvements beyond the baseline.\n\n\nThis cyclical process underscores the importance of structured training.\n\n\nMolecular Pathways in Training Adaptation\nTraining-induced adaptations occur through a network of molecular pathways, differing based on the type of activity:\n\nEndurance Training1:\n\nActivates pathways such as:\n\nPGC-1α (Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis).\nCaMK (Calmodulin-dependent kinases).\nCalcineurin.\nAMPK.\nMAPKs (Mitogen-activated protein kinases, e.g., ERK1/2, p38 MAPK).\n\nLeads to metabolic adaptations like mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, enhancing endurance capacity.\n\n\n\nResistance Training2:\n\nPrimarily stimulates the AKT-mTOR pathway, which promotes:\n\nMuscle hypertrophy.\nStrength and power gains.\nMyofibrillar protein synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR \nA[AMPK] &lt;--&gt; B(INHIBITS) \nC[mTORC1] &lt;--&gt; B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cell level interplay has got important practical implications.\nIn the early 1980s, Hickson’s groundbreaking research revealed that when individuals engaged in concurrent training (CT)—a combination of strength and endurance training—the adaptations from resistance training were diminished compared to those achieved through resistance training alone. Hickson initially termed this phenomenon the “Interference Effect”(Hickson 1980). Today, it is widely recognized as the “Concurrent Training Effect” (CTE).\nA training regimen with high energy demands can significantly activate mechanisms that inhibit pathways regulating muscle myofibrillar protein synthesis(Wilson et al. 2012). Specifically, endurance exercises characterized by high volume or distance, lasting over 20 minutes, performed at moderate intensity (below 85% of maximum heart rate), and executed continuously are likely to amplify the concurrent training effect (CTE) when included in a concurrent training program(Terzis et al. 2016).\nLow-volume high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or sprint interval training (SIT)(Coates et al. 2023), consisting of short sessions (4–10 minutes), appears to exert a minimal negative impact on resistance training adaptations within a concurrent training program(MacInnis and Gibala 2016). These training modalities, particularly when cycling is involved, have a lower overall energy demand compared to continuous endurance exercises of matched volume, making them less likely to interfere with the benefits of resistance training(Gibala et al. 2012).\nRecent studies strongly suggest that separating endurance and strength training sessions yields superior adaptations in endurance capacity, muscle hypertrophy, strength, and power compared to combining both into a single session. This idea, initially highlighted by Sale et al., demonstrates that scheduling these training types on different days or in distinct sessions enhances the benefits of each(SALE et al. 1990).\nOptimal results are achieved when resistance and endurance training sessions are spaced 3–6 hours apart (to prioritize resistance adaptations) or 24 hours apart (to enhance endurance outcomes). This separation likely minimizes potential overlap in the activation of myofibrillar and mitochondrial protein synthesis pathways, thereby maximizing the benefits of both training modalities(Methenitis 2018).",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\n\nHigh-volume, moderate-intensity, continuous, and frequent endurance training is believed to negatively impact resistance training-induced adaptations.\nThis effect likely occurs due to the inhibition of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, mediated by the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).\nEndurance/Aerobic exercises go with low calorie diet. Both have positive effect on life span.\nResistance exercises go with high protein intake. Both help in improving strength and balance.\nOne may not mix aerobic with resistance exercises. There should be at least 3-24 hrs. gap between them, depending on where your focus is on.\nLot of animal protein and strengthening exercises will increase muscle mass. But the same has got negative affect on life span.\nHence, limit animal protein and strengthening exercises to 2 days per week. Rest of the days, take less protein and do aerobic exercises3.\nExplore HIIT/SIT4",

Nor are they familiar enough with lack of variety in food and excessive round the clock stress. Cavemen were accustomed to bouts of physical exertion (for food, mates, and escaping enemies) and sporadic feasts with prolonged periods of an empty stomach.\nEmulating eating and exercise patterns in line with our ancestors in the form of HIIT/SIT could be promising.↩︎",

    "text": "Acquisition of procedural skills is a critical element in medical education.\nTraditionally, procedural skills are taught using a ‘‘see one - do one’’ approach, based on the Halsted’s teaching model (1904). Recently, two new teaching methods for the acquisition of procedural skills have been described:\n\nGeorge and Doto’s 5-Step Method:\n\nOverview: Explains why and how the skill is important.\nDemonstration: The preceptor performs the procedure.\nStudents Talk Through the Skill: The learner verbalizes the steps involved in the procedure.\nPerformance: The learner performs the procedure under supervision.\nAssessment of Performance: Identifies issues affecting learner’s performance, such as inherent ability, inappropriate task description, previous incorrect techniques, and affective factors. Corrective actions can be initiated based on the identified issues.\n\nThis method is based on Simpson’s taxonomy of the psychomotor domain, focusing on physical skills development. It was initially developed as an educational technique to support the American College of Surgeons’ Advanced Trauma Life Support course in 2001​\n\n\nPeyton’s 4-Step Method:\n\nDemonstration: The preceptor demonstrates the skill.\nDeconstruction: The procedure is broken down into parts.\nComprehension: The learner understands the steps and rationale behind the procedure.\nPerformance: The learner performs the procedure under supervision.\n\nPeyton’s method differs by combining the demonstration and deconstruction steps, emphasizing the learner’s comprehension and ability to perform the procedure independently​\nVideo showing Mr. J.W. Rodney Peyton FRCS discussing his concepts: \n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

The webpage also contains help and tutorials about the usage of MeSH and advanced search.\n\nWe can type in the keyword, say “Arthroscopy” and this will retrieve the proper MeSH term for that keyword. We can add that MeSH term to the search builder by clicking on the “Add to search builder” tab below the pubmed search builder.\n\nHaving added the first search term, we may add the second search term, say “Shoulder” by following the previous steps and using any of the 3 Boolean operators of our choice. We can gradually build the search keywords by adding more and more terms to the query.\n\nOnce finished with the MeSH search, click on the “search PubMed” field.\nAfter the new window is opened, click on advanced search and we will be able ot see all the search terms as shown below. It will show the individual MeSH search as well as the Boolean connected search. What the advanced search does extra is to allow us add text words to the query box and further build our query.\n\nWe can also add new search terms as text words in the Query box, search in the PubMed and add to the search builder.\ne.g., \"MRI\"[tw]\nSearch query can be finalised by clicking on the action button which allow connecting the individual search terms with necessary Boolean operator.\nThis specific PubMed query can be downloaded as .csv file or can be copied and pasted to a word processor for future reference.\n\n\nTruncation\nSome search terms will be similar but will be used as singular or pleural by different authors. e.g., fracture and fractures\nWe can tell the computer that both are same for the purpose of our query by adding ““ at the end of the word; fracture*.\nThis will include both fracture and fractures in our search",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThis is called a funnel plot which is a simple scatter plot of the treatment effects (RR or OR) estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against the precision of the studies represented by standard error (SE).\nThe vertical dotted line shows the estimated combined RR or OR from the meta-analysis. The diagonal dotted lines show the range in which studies should be ideally distributed given the size (and thus precision) of each study. Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested.\n\nNow what is this?\nThis funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones.\nTwo possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.\n\nIf so, what is this?\nThe funnel plot displays the % of observed 30-day mortality rate of operations on the Y-axis and the total number of operations on the X-axis. A practice lying on the line Y=1 has a surgeon performing close to average, whereas a practice lying above Y=1 has a the total number of operations that is higher than the average.\nImportant point\nFunnel plot is used to detect publication bias as well as outliers\n\nFunnel plot\n\nFunnel plot concepts\nIt is a representation of SEM plotted against the true population mean or the no effect line of a study in a graph. Smaller studies tend to have larger SEM and the larger studies will have smaller SEM. Hence the plot assumes a funnel shape. I an ideal world, funnel plot is supposed to form a symmetrical “funnel”. This is not the case in real world, because of various reasons.\n\n\n\nUses of funnel plot\nTo identify outliers. Eg: A surgical resident’s performance\nTo identify the validity of a meta-analysis. An asymmetrical funnel plot suggests a potential problem with the results of the meta-analysis.\n\n\nCauses of asymmetrical funnel plot\n\nReporting bias\n\nReporting bias\n\nPublication bias: Delayed reporting, language bias, duplication)\nSelective outcome reporting\nSelective analysis reporting\n\n\nPoor methodology\n\nDesign\nAnalysis\nFraud\n\nHeterogeneity\nChance\n\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nVariations over and above that is expected by chance\npredicts whether the data from different studies can be combined for meta-analysis to obtain a forest plot.\n\nCauses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical\nStatistical\n\n\n\n\nDifference in the population\nIndividual results are inconsistent\n\n\nDifference in the study design\nDifference in size of benefit\n\n\nDifference in intervention\nDifference in size of harm\n\n\nDifference in outcome\n\n\n\nAlways present\n\n\n\nCannot be statistically evaluated\nCan be evaluated statistically\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting Heterogeneity\n\nReview the table describing individual studies\n“eye ball test”, review the forest plot\nReview the statistical tests\nStatistical tests\nStatistical tests for detecting heterogeneity\n\n\n\nTests for its presence:\nChi Square test, p&gt;0.1 means study is homogenous\n\n\nTest to quantify:\nI2\nIt measures the % of heterogeneity\n\n≤25%=low\n50%= moderate\n≥75%= high)\n\n\n\nAnalysis of cause of heterogeneity\nOnce heterogeneity is identified and quantified, he have to analyse and find out why it is present\nThis is done by\n\nsubgroup analysis\nMeta regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Why should we use statistics at all?\nSimplest answer is we do not believe ourselves because it is basic human instinct to validate facts which confirm to our believes and to invalidate those facts which contradict our believes- a confirmation bias. It is an essential trait for survival.\nSocial and cultural evolution is lot more faster in pace and larger in scale when compared to natural evolution. Hence, lot of our instincts are not so developed to process the socio-cultural observations accurately and precisely.\nStatistics is the tool we should use when dealing with data. It is no more or no less than a tool. It is not a substitute for logical thinking. In fact it should instigate us to ponder more and understand the meaning of the stuff around us in a new light.",

One down side of mean-variance-risk assessment is that it assumes a symmetric distribution and secondly proposes to truncate variance on either side to reduce risk.\nIn fact variance is beneficial for buildup of the right side of the distribution and adds convexity to the benefit if we can mitigate the risk of large draw-downs on the left side.\nTwo metrics that specifically looks for tail risk are Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)\n\nVaR\nThis measures the maximum loss over a given time period with a certain confidence level. For example, VaR at a 95% confidence level is the loss that will not be exceeded with 95% probability.\n\n\nCVaR\nThis measures the expected loss given that the loss has exceeded the VaR threshold.

    "text": "First, we can summarise what we have learned from the previous post on risks: Market risk is not the only risk in market.\nWe invest into the future to meet future needs and wants. Historically, capital equity markets have outperformed other asset classes, so some of us tend to use equity as a vehicle to accumulate wealth. Market risk refers to the uncertainty in the average return we will realise by doing so. Beyond this, hidden risks—namely volatility risk, , inaction risk, and sequence of return risk—can affect our final Total Portfolio Value (TPV). We saw that the sequence in which we receive varying returns can have a profound impact on TPV, particularly when we are adding or, more importantly, withdrawing money from the portfolio. This risk vanishes if there are no additions or withdrawals, as CAGR is calculated by multiplying returns at different intervals of time.\nTPV = P * (1+r1 )* (1+r2 )*… * (1+rn )\nIn a series of multiplications, the order does not matter. This holds true if we withdraw or add a fixed percentage of the portfolio instead of a fixed amount of money, as in a SIP or SWP.\nAssume w is the fixed percentage we withdraw or add every period (say, yearly). The new returns will be:\nR1 = r1 ± w\nR2 = r2 ± w\nRn = rn ± w\nThe new formula becomes:\nTPV = P * (1+R1)* (1+R2)* … * (1+Rn)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSequence of return risk will not affect you if a fixed percentage of the portfolio is withdrawn instead of a fixed amount of money.\n\n\nHowever, by removing sequence of return risk from the portfolio, we introduce another problem: our withdrawal rate is fixed. This means the amount of money you may withdraw each year is uncertain; it depends on the TPV for that particular year, which is in turn dependent on the portfolio’s return for that year. A drawdown of 52% would reduce your withdrawal amount by 52%. This gives us another compelling reason to somehow trim downward volatility risk.\nOnce again, sequence of return risk affects you during both the accumulation phase and the distribution phase of wealth, if you add or withdraw a fixed amount of money. Below is an important graph depicting the effect of each year’s return on TPV (Pfau 2013). We are particularly vulnerable to what happens at the beginning of the distribution phase and in the 4-5 years following the start date of distribution. In fact, the first year’s return has a staggering 14% effect, which gradually reduces to around 7% by the 5th year.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nPfau, Wade D. 2013. “The Lifetime Sequence of Returns: A Retirement Planning Conundrum.” SSRN Electronic Journal. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2544637.",

    "text": "The Nifty index came into existence around 29 years ago in April 1996. If you had invested ₹100 on that date, you would have received a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.03%, with the initial corpus growing to ₹2296. We all know that in the future, the return may be lower, higher, or even the same. We are blind to the future return of the index, say, after another 29 years; this is what we may call market risk.\nThis average return cleverly hides other important risks: volatility risk, inaction risk and sequence of return risk. They require a little explanation to understand their true impact on us.\nSequence of return risk originates from the fact that, unlike an index, we have a life cycle, and we invest to meet life cycle events without having to beg for help. These events include non-discretionary and discretionary spending after retirement (forced or voluntary), child education, marriage expenses, medical expenses, etc., to mention a few. Hence, whether we like it or not, we have to involuntarily time the market—namely, the starting point of the investment journey, in-between investments (regular or irregular SIPs), and the endpoint when we start withdrawing money as a lump sum or as regular or irregular SWPs.\nEssentially, unlike an index, for us, the sequence in which the return is generated matters as much as the rate of return. We may try to understand this from the following example.\nMr. Mony, 65, painstakingly accumulated a corpus of ₹1 crore for his retirement. He retired in 2006 and plans to withdraw ₹4 lakhs every year. He has all his retirement corpus in a Nifty ETF. He did so thinking that in the long term, say, the next 30 years, the CAGR would beat inflation, unlike debt instruments like G-secs or bonds.\nLet us analyze his next 5 years. His realized returns are shown below:\n\n\n\nYear\nReturn\n\n\n\n\n2007\n+54%\n\n\n2008\n-52%\n\n\n2009\n+76%\n\n\n2010\n+18%\n\n\n2011\n-25%\n\n\n\nMr. Mony’s portfolio calculation for the 5 years is as follows:\n((10000000 * 1.54) - 400000) * 0.48 - 400000) * 1.76 - 400000) * 1.18 - 400000) * 0.75 - 400000) = ₹9,537,680\nHe ended up poorer by ₹462,320 in 2011.\nThis need not be the only sequence that may play out in the future. In fact, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways by which the sequence can play out, i.e., 120 different paths, of which he will experience only one. If all the returns play out in descending order of magnitude, what will be the total portfolio value (TPV) of the retirement fund after 5 years?\nReturns:\n\n\n\nReturn\n\n\n\n\n+76%\n\n\n+54%\n\n\n+18%\n\n\n-25%\n\n\n-52%\n\n\n\nTPV = (10000000 * 1.76) - 400000) * 1.54 - 400000) * 1.18 - 400000) * 0.75 - 400000) * 0.48 - 400000) = ₹10,492,313.60\nHe would have been richer by ₹492,313.60 in 2011.\nWhat would be the TPV if the returns were sequenced in reverse, in ascending order of magnitude?\n\n\n\nReturn\n\n\n\n\n-52%\n\n\n-25%\n\n\n+18%\n\n\n+54%\n\n\n+76%\n\n\n\nTPV = (10000000 * 0.48) - 400000) * 0.75 - 400000) * 1.18 - 400000) * 1.54 - 400000) * 1.76 - 400000) = ₹7,086,828.80\nHe would have lost around 30% of his corpus after 5 years, sitting on a loss of ₹2,913,171.20.\nIf he had never retired, he would not have faced this problem of sequence of return risk.\nTPV (Buy and hold):\n\nWith returns in ascending order: (10000000 * 0.48) * 0.75 * 1.18 * 1.54 * 1.76 = ₹11,513,779.20\nWith returns in descending order: (10000000 * 1.76) * 1.54 * 1.18 * 0.75 * 0.48 = ₹11,513,779.20\n\nIn summary, if we are buying and holding a volatile asset like an equity index, the sequence in which the return is received every year/month/day never matters. This is because CAGR is calculated by multiplying the periodic returns. If there are no additions or subtractions in between, the order in which we multiply never affects the final value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSequence of return risk not only affects the TPV when we withdraw but also equally affects TPV when we are periodically adding money through SIPs.\n\n\nWhat if we withdraw or add a fixed percentage instead of a fixed amount? When exactly in your life cycle does sequence of return risk bites you most? see sequence of return risk\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Several months ago, an economic adviser from a trading platform gave a lecture to a group of doctors on the benefits of equity investment. During his talk, he emphasized two key points:\n\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in equities are the best form of investment.\n\nAs India develops, the equity markets will generally trend upward.\n\nWhile these statements may seem reasonable, it is important to critically examine whether economic growth always translates into strong stock market returns.\nDoes economic growth always lead to strong stock market performance?\nOne of the most significant development stories of our time is China’s rapid economic growth. Between 2007 and 2020, China experienced unprecedented expansion, becoming the world’s second-largest economy and a global manufacturing powerhouse. However, what is often overlooked is how the stock market performed during this period.\n\nFor instance, if an investor had put ₹1,0000 in the Hang Seng Index (HSI) in January 2007, that investment would have grown to just ₹1,1560 by 2025. This reflects a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of only 0.78%—an underwhelming return given China’s economic rise.\nLet’s also consider the impact of a monthly SIP of ₹1,0000 in the HSI since 2007. Would dollar-cost averaging have helped improve returns, or would market stagnation over the years have still resulted in poor outcomes?\n\nprint(hsi)\n\n         sip       date\n       &lt;num&gt;     &lt;Date&gt;\n  1:  -10000 0002-01-07\n  2:  -10000 0001-02-07\n  3:  -10000 0001-03-07\n  4:  -10000 0002-04-07\n  5:  -10000 0001-05-07\n ---                   \n217:  -10000 0001-12-24\n218:  -10000 0001-01-25\n219:  -10000 0001-02-25\n220:  -10000 0001-03-25\n221: 2338091 0001-04-25\n\nxirr=xirr(hsi$sip,hsi$date)\nprint(xirr)\n\n[1] -0.06161213\n\n\nBased on the XIRR calculation for a consistent SIP of ₹1,0000 per month from 2007 to 2025, the return was -6%. This means that over 18 years, an investor would have not only failed to generate wealth but actually lost real capital!\nEngland and Japan are other striking examples with similar stagnation in stock market over an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nThe future cannot be predicted; instead, one should stay prepared for all possible outcomes.\n\n\nThis case study serves as a warning that stock markets do not always align with economic growth, and blind faith in equities can lead to disappointing results. A well-balanced investment strategy that considers valuation, market cycles, and risk management is essential for long-term success.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Independent of the state of the graft bed (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow, or cancellous autograft).\nOsteoconductive: Graft provides a scaffold for the ingrowth of capillaries and cells.\nOsteoinductive: Graft provides biologic stimulus for host cells to differentiate to form bone (e.g., BMPs, TGF-beta). The graft material itself does not contain these cells.\n\n\n\nClassification\n\nAutograft\n\nGraft harvested from and implanted in the same individual.\nContains viable host cells.\nBest graft option.\nVolume available is limited, leading to graft site morbidity.\n\nAllograft\n\nGraft taken from another individual of the same species.\nAllograft may be fresh, frozen, freeze-dried, or demineralized.\nCells are destroyed in the process.\n\nXenograft\n\nGraft obtained from a different species, often bovine or porcine.\n\nSynthetic graft\n\n\n\nSources\n\nCancellous bone: Best option but volume available is limited.\nCortical bone\nOsteochondral grafts\nBone marrow: Contains osteogenic and osteoinductive factors.\n\n\n\nDangers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraft Type\nRisks\n\n\n\n\nAutograft\nGraft site morbidity (scar, pain, infection, fracture)\n\n\nAllograft\nInfection transmission (2 in a million risk of Hepatitis C or HIV), increased infection risk, immune reaction, malignant cell implantation\n\n\n\n\n\nGraft Incorporation\n\nHost bone grows into and replaces the graft.\nAllograft incorporates more slowly due to being less osteogenic and causing an immune response. Allograft may also be rejected.\nCancellous graft incorporates quicker than cortical graft due to a greater cell volume.\n\n\nCancellous Autograft Incorporation Process\n\nInflammatory response\nCreeping substitution\n\nGraft stimulates osteoblast activity (osteoinduction).\nOsteoclastic resorption of the graft follows.\nThe graft is eventually completely replaced by creeping substitution.\nX-rays at this stage appear denser, and bone is at its strongest.\n\nRemodeling\n\nBone density reduces, as does strength over time, following Wolff’s law.\n\n\n\nCancellous grafts achieve early structural strength as osteoblasts lay down bone onto the graft early on.\n\n\n\nCortical Graft Incorporation\n\nInflammatory response\nOsteoclast cutting cones: All donor bone must be removed before appositional bone formation occurs. Mechanical strength is reduced by 50% during this process.\nOsteoblasts: With vessels, migrate into cutting cone channels and lay down lamellar bone.\n\n\nThere is no remodeling phase.\nMechanical strength takes 1-2 years to recover.\nIncorporation is often incomplete.\n\n\n\nAllograft Incorporation (Cortical or Cancellous)\n\nFollows a similar process but is much slower.\nHigher chance of rejection due to a pronounced immune response, which is cellular (not humoral) and mediated by host T cells.\n\n\n\nVascularized Graft Incorporation\n\nIncorporates like a healing fracture since the biological and mechanical environment is similar.\n\n\n\n\nBone Graft Substitutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCalcium Phosphates\ne.g., tricalcium phosphate, Norion (injectable). Undergoes partial conversion to hydroxyapatite. Degrades slowly, providing structural support (e.g., tibial plateau). Good osteoconductivity.\n\n\nHydroxyapatite\nDoes not incite any immune response.\n\n\nOther\nVarious types of calcium sulfate (e.g., Osteoset), ceramic, silicone, and synthetic polymers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoinductive Agents\n\nTGF Beta: Induces the formation of type 2 collagen.\nBMPs (Bone Morphogenic Proteins):\n\n20 types; only BMP-2 and BMP-7 approved for use in orthopedic surgery (in the USA).\nBMP-2 is the most osteogenic and primarily osteoinductive.\nOP-1 (BMP 7) proven effective in tibial non-union.\n\nPDGF: Platelet-derived growth factor.\nFDGF: Fibroblast-derived growth factor.\n\n\n\nBone Banking\n\nPrinciples\n\nWritten consent is required if the donor is living.\nFor cadavers, no objection from the next of kin is required.\n\n\n\nScreening\n\nBlood tests and history are used to highlight contraindications.\n\nExclusions: - HIV, Hepatitis, malignancy, chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases), steroid treatment, Alzheimer’s, CJD, MS.\n\n\nAvailable Products from Bone Banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFresh Frozen Femoral Heads\nAvailable only to hospitals that collect them.\n\n\nCancellous Cubes\nFreeze-dried in 1cm cubed size; purely osteoconductive with no viable cells.\n\n\nCortical Struts\nFrom femoral shafts, ranging from 2-22 cm, freeze-dried or gamma-irradiated.\n\n\nMassive Allografts\nProximal and distal femora and tibiae available; frozen and gamma-irradiated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllograft Processing Techniques\n\nPhysical debridement.\nUltrasonic and ethanol treatments.\nAntibiotic soaks.\nIrradiation (reduces mechanical strength).\nDemineralization.\n\n\n\nAllograft Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nFresh\nImmunogenic, therefore not typically done.\n\n\nFresh Frozen (-70°C)\nPreserves BMPs, little impact on mechanical strength, reduces immunogenicity.\n\n\nFreeze-Dried\nSafest regarding disease transmission and immune response, eliminates BMPs, reduces mechanical strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Methods of Augmenting Bone Healing\n\nDistant Corticotomy: Within the same bone, it stimulates healing elsewhere in the bone.\nElectromagnetic effect: Piezoelectric currents.\nUltrasound: Low-intensity ultrasound shown to affect gene expression, increase osteoblast activity, and stimulate blood flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Composition of Articular Cartilage\nArticular cartilage is composed of different components that contribute to its structure and function. The table below outlines the wet and dry weight distribution of these components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWet Weight\nDry Weight\n\n\n\n\nWater\n75%\n-\n\n\nCollagen\n20%\n70%\n\n\nChondrocytes\n5%\n-\n\n\nProteoglycans\n10%\n-\n\n\nOther\n-\nGlycoproteins, enzymes, extracellular ions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Articular Cartilage\nArticular cartilage consists of individual chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix, forming a 3D cartilaginous framework. It is organized into four layers:\n\nSuperficial Gliding Zone\n\nThinnest layer with the highest collagen and water content.\n\nLowest proteoglycan content.\n\nCollagen fibers run parallel to the surface, providing resistance to shear stress and high tensile stiffness.\n\nCovered by Lamina Splendens, a protective film.\n\nMiddle Transitional Zone\n\nCollagen fibers arranged obliquely.\n\nActs as a transition zone for shear forces and compressive forces.\n\nDeep Radial Zone\n\nThickest zone with the highest proteoglycan concentration and low collagen content.\n\nCollagen fibers are arranged perpendicular to the surface, making it resistant to compressive forces.\n\nCalcified Zone\n\nContains calcified cartilage and is anchored to subchondral bone by hydroxyapatite crystals.\n\nVirtually no type 2 collagen; mostly type 10 collagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollagen in Articular Cartilage\nCollagen synthesis occurs both inside and outside chondrocytes, leading to the formation of collagen fibers. The synthesis process involves:\n\nFormation of polypeptide chains within chondrocytes.\nAssembly of a triple helix structure called Pro-collagen in the Golgi apparatus.\nRelease of pro-collagen into the extracellular matrix, where it forms Tropo-Collagen.\nTropo-Collagen crosslinks to form collagen fibers.\n\nType 2 Collagen is the most abundant, making up 90% of cartilage collagen. It is stable with a half-life of 25 years and provides tensile strength.\nOther Types of Collagen: - Type 10 Collagen: Found in the calcified zone, associated with cartilage calcification. - Type 11 Collagen: Regulates fiber diameter and holds the lattice together. - Type 9 Collagen: Present on the cartilage surface. - Type 6 Collagen: Carries shear stresses and increases in osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\nProteoglycans\nProteoglycans are large, hydrophilic molecules that interact with water, providing cartilage with compressive strength. The most common proteoglycan is Aggrecan, which forms aggregates with hyaluronic acid, enhancing water retention and interactions with collagen.\nGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are proteoglycan subunits: - Chondroitin Sulfate: Decreases with age but increases in osteoarthritis. - Keratin Sulfate: Increases with age.\n\n\n\nChondrocytes\nChondrocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into articular or physeal chondrocytes. Their primary functions include: 1. Collagen production. 2. Proteoglycan production. 3. Enzyme secretion for cartilage metabolism (metalloproteinases).\n\n\n\nNutrition and Nerve Supply\n\nAvascular: Articular cartilage lacks blood vessels and receives nutrients through diffusion from the synovial fluid.\n\nLoading of joints helps squeeze out waste, while unloading allows nutrient diffusion.\n\nAneural: Cartilage has no nerve supply.\n\n\n\n\nFunction of Articular Cartilage\n\nJoint Lubrication\nShock Absorption\n\nArticular cartilage has excellent biomechanical properties: - Low friction (more effective than joint replacements). - 10 times more efficient at shock absorption than bone.\n\n\n\nCartilage Lubrication\n\nFluid Film Lubrication: Dominant during movement, particularly elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication.\nBoundary Lubrication: Acts during rest.\n\n\n\n\nPathological States of Cartilage\n\nSuperficial Lacerations: Do not heal due to avascularity.\nDeep Lacerations: Heal by fibrocartilage formation but cannot bear repetitive loading as effectively as type 2 collagen.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in Cartilage with Aging and Osteoarthritis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nAging\nOsteoarthritis\n\n\n\n\nWater Content\nDecreases\nIncreases\n\n\nSynthetic Activity\nDecreases\nIncreases\n\n\nCollagen Content\nDecreases\nDecreases (concentration increases)\n\n\nProteoglycan Content\nDecreases\nDecreases\n\n\nChondrocyte Size\nIncreases\n-\n\n\nChondrocyte Number\nDecreases\n-\n\n\nChondroitin: Keratin Ratio\nDecreases\nIncreases\n\n\nStiffness (Young’s Modulus)\nIncreases\nDecreases (due to high water content)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis develops due to two primary mechanisms: 1. Increased degrading enzyme concentration. 2. Direct trauma to cartilage.\nThe condition leads to:\n\nDamaged collagen meshwork.\n\n\n\nIncreased water content and proteoglycan synthesis.\n\n\n\nCompromised load\n\n\n\nbearing ability, leading to cartilage fatigue and eventual degeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Embryonic Germ Cell Layers\nThe human embryo consists of four distinct germ cell layers that give rise to different tissues:\n\nEctoderm (outer layer)\nMesoderm (middle layer)\nEndoderm (inner layer)\nNeural Crest\nConsidered a fourth germ cell layer due to its early presence in development.\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Skeletal Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Frame\nDevelopmental Milestone\n\n\n\n\n4 Weeks\nLimb buds appear, with the upper limb developing 48 hours before the lower limb.\n\n\n8 Weeks\nLimbs rotate 90 degrees: the upper limb rotates externally, while the lower limb rotates internally (thumb lateral, big toe medial).\n\n\n12 Weeks\nPrimary ossification centers of long bones are present (humerus is the first to appear, followed by the femur).\n\n\n36 Weeks\nSecondary ossification centers begin to appear, with the distal femur being the first.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimb Bud Development\n\nLimb development follows a well-defined pattern along three axes:\n\nProximo-distal Axis (longitudinal)\nThe Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER) is a key structure in limb development that plays a crucial role in controlling the proximal-distal growth of the limb, meaning it governs the extension of the limb from the body (proximal) to the tip of the limb (distal).\nThe AER is a thickened area of ectoderm (the outer layer of cells) located along the tip of the developing limb bud. The AER secretes signaling molecules, such as Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs), which stimulate the growth of underlying mesenchymal cells in the limb bud, promoting the elongation of the limb along the proximal-distal axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nControlled by the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER)\nRegulated by the Homeobox gene\n\n\nAntero-posterior (medio-lateral)\nThe Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA) is a critical signaling region located at the posterior side of the developing limb bud, near where the future little finger will form.\nThe ZPA plays a key role in determining the anterior-posterior axis of the limb, which is the direction from the thumb (anterior) to the little finger (posterior). The ZPA produces a signaling molecule called Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), which diffuses from the posterior side of the limb bud toward the anterior side, creating a concentration gradient.\nHigh levels of Shh promote the development of structures on the posterior side, such as the little finger.\nLower levels of Shh on the anterior side contribute to the formation of structures like the thumb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nControlled by the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA)\nRegulated by the Sonic Hedgehog gene\n\n\nDorso-ventral Axis (anterior-posterior)\n\nControlled by the surface ectoderm overlaying the mesoderm\nThe dorsal surface grows faster, causing the limbs to curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\nFunction\nDevelopmental Disorders\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAER (Apical Ectodermal Ridge)\nRegulates proximodistal growth of the limb.\nPhocomelia\nSevere shortening or absence of limbs.\n\n\n\n\nAmelia\nComplete absence of one or more limbs.\n\n\n\n\nMeromelia\nPartial absence of a limb.\n\n\nZPA (Zone of Polarizing Activity)\nEstablishes anterior-posterior axis (thumb to little finger orientation).\nPolydactyly\nExtra fingers or toes (duplication).\n\n\n\n\nSyndactyly\nFusion of fingers or toes due to disruption in ZPA signaling.\n\n\n\n\nRadial Club Hand\nStructures on the radial side of the limb, such as the radius and thumb, are underdeveloped or absent.\n\n\n\n\nMirror Hand Syndrome (Ulnar Dimelia)\nDuplication of the ulnar side of the hand (usually with extra digits), caused by ZPA misregulation.\n\n\nSurface Ectoderm of Limb Bud\nDifferentiates into skin and helps in limb morphogenesis.\nEctrodactyly (Split Hand/Foot Malformation)\nAbsence of one or more central digits, forming a “cleft” hand or foot.\n\n\n\n\nNail-Patella Syndrome\nAbnormalities of nails, knees, elbows, and pelvis due to ectodermal disruption.\n\n\n\n\nCleft Hand/Foot\nAbnormal cleft between fingers or toes due to failure of surface ectoderm closure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of Joints and Ossification Centers\nThe process of joint and bone formation involves multiple steps:\n\nChondrification\n\nMesenchymal cells in the mesoderm differentiate into chondrocytes, forming a cartilaginous skeletal anlage.\n\nJoint Formation\n\nSegmentation, resorption, and cavitation of the cartilaginous anlage create primitive joints, with intra-articular structures developing through resorption and differentiation.\n\nOssification\n\nPrimary ossification centers appear due to the hypertrophy of mid-diaphyseal chondrocytes, vascular invasion, and the development of the nutrient artery system.\nPeriosteal intramembranous ossification occurs first, followed by enchondral ossification at the physis.\nSecondary ossification centers develop in the epiphysis around 30-36 weeks, following vascular invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinal Development\nThe development of the spinal column is closely regulated by the Homeobox gene and occurs as follows:\n\nA mid-sagittal groove forms in the ectoderm.\nThe groove deepens, folding into itself to create the neural tube.\n\nFailure of closure results in spina bifida.\n\nNeural crest cells lie dorsally, while the notocord lies ventrally, with the neural tube in between.\n\n\n\n\nKey Structures Derived from Embryonic Layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\nOrigin\n\n\n\n\nNeural Crest\nPeripheral nervous system, basal ganglia, sympathetic chain\n\n\nNeural Tube\nSpinal cord\n\n\nNotocord\nVertebrae, intervertebral discs, and spinal muscles\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinal Column Development\nThe spinal column develops entirely from the notocord.

    "text": "Plain X-Ray\n\nX-rays are high-energy radiation, which undergo differential absorption by tissues as they pass through the body.\n\nX-ray Beam Generation: - A tungsten cathode is heated in a vacuum. - Generates high-velocity electrons directed toward a tungsten anode. - On hitting the anode, some electrons are knocked out of orbit to create X-rays (only 1% of these electrons are used to make the X-ray beam).\nQuantity and Quality of X-rays Generated: - Quantity of X-rays is proportional to the number of moving electrons. - Quality of X-rays is proportional to the speed of the electrons (energy they carry).\nX-ray Cassette: - Carbon fiber front, lead backing, and a film coated in photographic emulsion (silver iodobromide). - Carbon fiber and lead prevent X-ray scatter.\nImage Processing: - X-rays captured on the film as black silver crystals. - Digital images have lower resolution than plain films due to a finite grey scale.\nTypes of X-ray Radiation: - Primary: Beam directed from the tube to the X-ray plate/cassette. - Secondary: Scatter of X-rays reflected from the patient or other objects, causing blur.\nParameters of X-ray Measurement: - kV: Penetration of X-rays (energy carried). - mA: Measurement of X-ray strength (volume of X-rays). - Total X-ray dose: Measured in Grey. - Effective dose: Measured in Sieverts.\nEffective Dose Comparisons: - Bone scan = 5.0 mSv. - CT Spine = 3.6 mSv. - Chest X-ray = 0.05 mSv.\n\n\n\nCT Scanning\n\nX-rays are delivered by a fan-shaped rotating tube on a gantry, and sensitive detectors record the attenuated X-rays to form an image.\nEach image is made up of pixels (each pixel has depth, termed a voxel).\n\nAttenuation: - Describes the amount of X-rays absorbed by tissues. - Hounsfield Units (HU) describe the attenuation coefficient of tissues: - Bone: +1000 HU - Water: 0 HU - Air: -1000 HU\nAdvantages: - Reconstructions possible in any plane. - Excellent for surgical planning in complex fractures. - Superior resolution of cortical bone.\nDisadvantages: - High radiation dose. - Claustrophobia.\n\n\n\nMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\n\nUses superconducting magnets and radiofrequency (RF) coils to manipulate hydrogen ions (protons) to create high-contrast images.\n\nMechanism: - Protons spin around their own axis (nuclear spin). - A magnetic field aligns their spin longitudinally. - Energy delivered by RF pulse causes protons to spin transversely. - Once the RF pulse is turned off, protons realign and release energy, detected by RF receiver coils.\nImaging Terms: - T2: Time taken for protons to lose coherence. - T1: Time taken for 63% of protons to return to longitudinal spin. - TR: Time between repetition of pulses (T2 has higher TR times). - TE: Time to Echo (T2 has higher TE times).\nCommon Sequences: - T2 Weighted: Fluid and fat appear white. - T1 Weighted: Fat appears white. - STIR (fat suppression): T2 weighted with dark fat.\nGadolinium: Contrast agent that enhances imaging, showing pathologic fluid collections better (abscess).\n\n\n\nRadionuclide Bone Scanning\n\nUses gamma rays emitted from a radioactive isotope (Technetium-99) bound to phosphate to map blood flow and osteoblast activity.\n\nTechnetium-99: - Unstable radioisotope derived from Molybdenum-99 decay. - Short half-life of 6 hours and is excreted via kidneys.\nMechanism: - Technetium-99 is attached to Methyl Diphosphonate (MDP) and injected intravenously. - MDP interacts with hydroxyapatite crystals in bone, directly reflecting osteoblastic activity. - Gamma rays emitted by Technetium-99 are detected by a gamma camera to create a digital image.\nPhases of a Triple Phase Bone Scan: - Dynamic Phase (1-2 min): Shows arterial flow and hyperperfusion. - Equilibrium Phase (3-5 min): Shows bone and soft tissue hyperemia. - Static Phase (4 hours): Soft tissue activity clears, leaving only bone activity.\nUses: - Tumors, infections, stress fractures, prosthetic loosening, Paget’s disease.\nDisadvantages: - Poor specificity but very sensitive. - False negatives in areas with low blood supply (e.g., avascular bone).\n\n\n\nDEXA Scanning (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)\n\nUtilizes X-rays of different energies absorbed differently by bone and soft tissue.\nUsed to assess bone mineral density (BMD).\n\nResult Interpretation: - T Score: Compares BMD to peak young adult BMD. - Z Score: Compares BMD to an age-matched individual.\nWHO Criteria for Osteoporosis: - 0 to -1: Normal. - -1 to -2.5: Osteopenia. - &lt; -2.5: Osteoporosis. - &lt; -2.5 + fragility fracture: Severe osteoporosis.\n\n\n\nUltrasound\n\nUltrasound waves are produced by a piezoelectric ceramic crystal within a transducer.\nVoltage applied to the crystal alters its shape, generating a compression wave (ultrasound wave).\nReflected waves distort the piezoelectric crystal, generating an image.\n\nAdvantages: - Non-ionizing, cheap, portable, and dynamic imaging.\nDisadvantages: - Limited to superficial structures and is operator-dependent.\n\nThis webpage provides a detailed overview of different imaging techniques used in medical practice, including X-ray, CT, MRI, radionuclide scanning, DEXA scanning, and ultrasound. Each technique has distinct advantages, limitations, and specific uses in clinical diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

The optimal number of twists is 4-8.\nNotch Sensitivity: A 1% notch in the wire can reduce tensile strength by 60%.\nCable: Has higher fatigue resistance than wire.\nAlternatives: Number 5 Ethibond has 30% tensile strength of an 18g wire, and Mersilene tape has 50% of an 18g wire.\n\n\n\nScrews:\n\nPurpose: Convert rotational motion into linear motion, creating compressive force.\n\n\nScrew Pullout Factors:\n\nIncreases With:\n\nLarger screw diameter\nLonger embedded length\nHigh-quality bone\nMore surface area and cortical purchase\nIncreased thread depth and pitch\n\nCannulated Screws: Lower pullout strength (15% less than non-cannulated screws), as the core diameter is increased, reducing thread depth and rigidity.\n\n\n\nComponents of a Screw:\n\nCore Diameter: Diameter of the screw’s core.\nOuter Diameter: Total diameter of the screw.\nEffective Thread Depth: The difference between core and outer diameter (larger depth increases pullout strength).\nPitch: Distance traveled per screw turn (increased pitch lowers pullout strength; decreased pitch increases it).\nHead: Allows driver attachment, halts motion.\nTap: Creates a female helix for screw threads. Self-tapping screws cut threads automatically.\n\n\n\n\nNails:\n\nStrength: Bending and torsional rigidity increase with the 4th power of radius (doubling the radius increases rigidity by 16 times).\nSlotted Nails: Similar calculations but take into account the inner diameter, making them weaker than solid nails.\nAdvantage: Nails act as load-sharing devices but are vulnerable in metaphyseal fractures due to increased stress on the locking screws and bolts.\n\n\nDesign Improvements:\n\nMaterial Around Locking Holes: Increased to prevent failure.\nScrews Locking into Nails: Enhance stability.\nWorking Length: The unsupported length, longer lengths result in less stiffness and greater stress.\n\n\n\n\nPlates:\n\nWeaknesses: More prone to failure due to low bending rigidity. They rely on the fracture reduction for stability, functioning as load-sharing devices.\nPositioning: Plates should be placed on the tensile side of the bone to prevent fracture gapping and reduce bending moments.\nPre-bending: Helps avoid gapping on the far cortex, improving the load distribution.\n\n\nLocking Plates:\n\nFixed Angle Construct: Near the mechanical axis, eliminating weak points between screws and the plate.\nBenefits: Avoids periosteal blood supply disruption and enables minimally invasive application.\nChallenges: Excessive stiffness and lack of compression can cause non-union, and cross-threading can reduce stiffness.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Fixation:\n\nWorking Length: As in nails and plates, working length is critical for construct stiffness. Placing bars closer to the skin shortens working length, increasing stiffness.\nStiffness Factors:\n\nIncreasing the size of pins or bars.\nShortening the working length from the fracture.\nAdding more pins and bars.\nReducing the distance from the bars to the skin.\n\n\n\n\nForces and Effects on Orthopedic Implants:\n\nStrength: Depends on material properties and structure shape. Tubular structures are more vulnerable to torsion.\nStiffness: A material’s ability to resist deformation. Stress divided by strain.\nRigidity: A structural property that refers to the ability to resist deformation.\n\n\nPlates:\n\nRigidity: Increases with the 3rd power of thickness (doubling thickness increases rigidity 8 times).\n\n\n\nTubular Structures:\n\nTorsional Rigidity: Proportional to the 4th power of radius (doubling radius increases torsional rigidity 16 times).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Loss of more than 50% can cause posterior instability, but an intact radial head may compensate.\n\nThe anteromedial part is especially important as the MCL anterior band attaches here via the sublime tubercle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedial Collateral Ligament\nFunction\n\n\n\n\nAnterior band\nMost important, tight in extension, slack in flexion.\n\n\nPosterior band\nTight in flexion, slack in extension.\n\n\nTransverse ligament (Cooper’s ligament)\nRole in stability is less significant.\n\n\n\n\nLateral Collateral Ligament:\n\nConsists of the lateral radial collateral ligament, lateral ulnar collateral ligament, accessory lateral collateral ligament, and the annular ligament.\nThe ulnar collateral ligament is the most important for varus and posterolateral rotatory stability, and is usually the first ligament torn in a dislocation.\n\nAnterior Capsule: Resists hyperextension and posterior translation.\n\n\n\nDynamic Stability\n\nProvided by muscles crossing the joint, which offer limited stability themselves.\n\n\n\n\nElbow Replacement\nElbow replacements can be classified as linked or unlinked: - Unlinked: - Rely on intact collateral ligaments and articular congruency for stability. - Technically challenging to balance and thus falling out of favor.\n\nLinked:\n\nNot a fixed hinge, but a “sloppy hinge” with 6 degrees of freedom.\nAllows for 7-10 degrees of varus-valgus laxity, reducing stress on the bone-implant interface and preventing premature loosening or fracture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Femoral rollback\nFemur rolls and slides posteriorly during flexion to increase the lever arm of quadriceps enhancing their functional capability and also to allow for deeper knee flexion.\nHowever, femoral rollback is not symmetric due to the differing articular geometries of the medial and lateral compartments. In the medial compartment, the large medial femoral condyle (MFC) conforms to the convex medial plateau, while the medial meniscus is relatively fixed with only 0.5 cm of excursion, resulting in fairly uniform flexion. Conversely, in the lateral compartment, the lateral plateau is concave, and the lateral meniscus is mobile, allowing for an 11 cm excursion. This mobility permits the femoral condyle to slide and rollback on the lateral plateau. The differential rollback creates a polycentric instant center of rotation during flexion, resulting in a J-shaped curve when plotted, as it moves posteriorly with flexion. Additionally, the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) externally rotates during flexion, which corresponds to relative tibial internal rotation, and internally rotates during extension, corresponding to relative tibial external rotation. The knee achieves a “screw-home” mechanism and locks the knee in full extension, which is the most conforming and stable position for the joint. In this extended position, the cruciate ligaments are taut, further enhancing joint stability. Energy expended by the muscles to keep knee in this position is zero.\nThe popliteus muscle originates from the posteromedial border of the tibia and extends to the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC). Its primary function is to unlock the knee from the extended position. Upon contraction, the popliteus facilitates femoral external rotation and tibial internal rotation, allowing for the transition from full extension to flexion.\nPopliteus flexus and LaFtER",

    "text": "Patellofemoral joint\nThe patellofemoral joint plays a crucial role in knee function, with the patella acting as a pulley that enhances the quadriceps lever arm. This biomechanical advantage is significant, as evidenced by studies showing that patellectomy can lead to a 20% decrease in quadriceps power.\nThe Q angle, formed by a line from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the center of the patella and a line from the center of the patella to the tibial tuberosity, typically ranges from 5 to 20 degrees, with women often exhibiting a larger Q angle. An increased Q angle can result from any condition that result in lateralization of the ASIS or tibial tuberosity, leading to a lateral pull on the patella during extension and contributing to flexion instability. This can cause uneven distribution of patellofemoral contact pressures, which may contribute to the development of patellar arthrosis. Factors such as an increased Q angle, a shallow trochlea (dysplastic), or a deficient medial patella facet (Wiberg type 3) can exacerbate this issue. In normal patellofemoral motion, the patella engages the trochlea at about 20 degrees of flexion, conforming well to the groove during deep flexion; however, it is most prone to instability in extension. The patella’s contact pressures are significant, with the thickest cartilage in the body measuring approximately 1 cm. During flexion, the contact pressure is about 0.5 times body weight, while activities such as going upstairs and downstairs increase this pressure to 2.5 times and 3.3 times body weight, respectively.",

High conformity minimizes point loading, which in turn reduces wear.\nFull Constraint\n- A fully constrained knee design provides the highest level of conformity, allowing movement in only one plane. This results in low wear due to high conformity and low point loading; however, it can lead to greater stress at the implant-bone or implant-cement interface, increasing the risk of loosening.\nFully Unconstrained\n- Conversely, a completely unconstrained and unconforming design allows for excessive motion and high degrees of flexion but leads to edge loading and wear. Loosening is typically not a significant issue with these designs.\n\n\n\nGoals of TKR\nClinical Goals\n- The primary clinical goals of TKR include reducing pain, increasing function, maintaining range of motion (ROM), and avoiding complications.\nBiomechanical Goals\n1. Restoration of the mechanical axis\n2. Preservation of the joint line level\n3. Creation of equal flexion and extension gaps\n4. Well-balanced ligaments\n5. Durable component fixation\n\n\n\nDesign Variables in TKR\nDegree of Component Conformity\n- There is a trade-off between wear, ROM, and loosening.\nFixation Method\n- Options include metal-backed trays or all-polyethylene components.\nFemoral Radius of Curvature\n- Variations include large anterior, small posterior, or single curvature.\nPolyethylene Properties\n- Factors include type, shape, thickness, manufacturing, and storage.\nLevel of Constraint\n- Options include PCL-retaining, PCL-sacrificing, and semi/fully constrained designs.\nPolyethylene Thickness\n- Aim for a minimum thickness of 8 mm, with 10 mm preferred to ensure durability. Thickness below 8 mm increases wear characteristics.\n\n\n\nFemoral and Tibial Cuts\nThe tibia is cut perpendicular to the mechanical axis to prevent uneven loading of bearing surfaces, even though the normal tibia is in 3 degrees varus. If femoral anterior-posterior (AP) cuts were anatomic, this would create an uneven flexion gap. Therefore, AP femoral cuts are made with 3 degrees greater external rotation than the epicondylar axis, ensuring that the femoral component is parallel to the tibial cut in flexion, which creates a rectangular flexion gap.\nThe distal femoral cut (valgus cut angle) reflects the difference between the anatomical and mechanical axes of the femur, making the cut parallel to the joint line to create a rectangular extension gap. The normal setting is 5-7 degrees valgus; care must be taken with very short or very tall individuals or those with previous trauma or known dysplasia.\n\n\n\nJudging Femoral Rotation\nProper femoral rotation is critical for creating a rectangular flexion gap and affects patellar tracking. The epicondylar axis is typically present, even in revision situations. The Whitesides line, extending from the deepest part of the femoral sulcus to the deepest part of the trochlea, should be perpendicular to the femoral axis of rotation. The posterior condyles should be parallel to the rotation axis; caution is advised if the posterior condyles, particularly the lateral condyle, are worn, as this can cause internal rotation.\nTo ensure accuracy, the tibial cut should be made first, as the tibial cut must be correct to reference rotation accurately.\n\n\n\nLigament Balancing\nVarus Deformity - Releases should be performed on the concave side from the tibia:\n1. Osteophytes\n2. Deep medial collateral ligament (MCL)\n3. Posteromedial corner and semimembranosus\n4. Superficial MCL\n5. PCL\nValgus Deformity - Releases should be performed on the femur:\n1. Osteophytes\n2. Lateral capsule\n3. Iliotibial band (ITB) (if the knee is tight in extension)\n4. Popliteus (if the knee is tight in flexion)\n5. Lateral collateral ligament (LCL)\n6. Lateral head of the gastrocnemius\nFixed Flexion - Addressing fixed flexion involves:\n1. Osteophytes\n2. Increasing the distal femoral cut\n3. PCL recession\n4. Posterior capsule (pie crusting)\n5. Complete release of the PCL\n\n\n\nImportance of PCL\nThe PCL’s primary function is to prevent flexion instability and excessive posterior translation of the tibia while permitting physiological femoral rollback. It prevents impingement of the femur on the tibia, allowing for high flexion. Additionally, the PCL serves as a secondary restraint in varus and valgus stability. PCL-retaining designs maintain femoral rollback and normal kinematics, offering significant advantages.\n\n\n\nPatellofemoral Joint in TKR\nThe patellofemoral joint is particularly important in cases of inflammatory arthritis, as the disease can affect the PCL, leading to greater instability due to the soft tissue component.\nTypes of Implants: - Dome: Eliminates problems with rotational alignment; the most common design. - Anatomic: Provides better conformity but has a lower margin for error in positioning. - Mobile Bearing: Metal-backed, providing another interface for wear while reducing polyethylene thickness.\n\n\n\nTracking Issues\nAny alteration in the Q angle can lead to maltracking and impingement pain. Malrotation of components, including internal rotation of the femur or tibial component, can cause relative external rotation when the knee is reduced. This can be minimized by laterally positioning the patella button and lateralizing the femoral component.\n\n\n\nPatella Baja\nPatella baja occurs due to elevation of the joint line or excessive distal femoral resection, resulting in shortening of the patellar tendon. This can lead to impingement of the patella’s distal pole on the polyethylene in flexion.\n\n\n\nFailure in TKR – Technical Reasons\nPoly Thickness: - If the polyethylene is too thin (&lt;8 mm), contact pressures may exceed the yield strength, leading to early wear.\nPoorly Conforming Design: - Results in increased contact pressures and greater wear.\nBackside Wear of Poly: - Occurs between the polyethylene and the base plate; more prevalent in all TKRs, though reduced by using an all-polyethylene tibia.\nManufacturing Issues: - Previously a cause of catastrophic failure.\nLoosening: - Increased stress on the bone-cement or cement-implant interface, often seen in highly constrained designs.\nInstability: - Can result from poor balancing or malrotation of components, leading to patellofemoral maltracking.\nPatellofemoral Overstuffing: - Can occur from oversizing or undercutting the femur.\nPoor Fixation Technique: - Issues such as inadequate cement interdigitation or concerns with uncemented tibia.\nInfection: - Risks are heightened by excessive surgical time, poor technique, and soft tissue damage.\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Mobile Bearing TKR\nMobile bearing designs, including meniscal or rotating platform types, are intended to allow component conformity while reducing stress at the implant-bone interface, thereby minimizing loosening. These designs have not yet been conclusively shown to outperform fixed bearing designs, with the main complication being polyethylene spin-out or dislocation.",

    "text": "Understanding the biomechanics of the hip joint and applying them to Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery is essential for achieving long-term success. The principles discussed here revolve around minimizing joint reaction forces (JRF) and optimizing functional outcomes.\n\nFree Body Analysis in THR\nA free body analysis of the hip assumes the body is in a single-leg stance.\nKey points include:\n- Leg weight: Each leg is approximately 1/6th of the total body weight.\n- Joint Reaction Force (JRF): Determined by the interaction of the abductor muscles and the body weight (5/6th of total body weight to account for the non-weight-bearing leg).\n- Abductor Force: The force generated by the abductor muscles counters body weight to elevate the contralateral pelvis during normal gait.\n- Osteoarthritis (OA): As cartilage wears away in OA, friction increases, necessitating a higher abductor force to maintain movement, which in turn raises the JRF and causes more pain.\n\nMethods to Alter Forces\n\nIncrease Abductor Force:\n\nCarrying a suitcase on the same (ipsilateral) side.\nLateralizing the greater trochanter (GT).\nUsing a high offset stem.\n\nReduce Body Weight Force:\n\nLosing weight.\nAdopting a Trendelenberg gait.\nUsing a walking stick on the opposite (contralateral) side.\n\nOther Biomechanical Adjustments:\n\nMedializing the acetabular cup.\nUsing a smaller femoral head size.\nEmploying thinner polyethylene.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharnley’s Principles of THR\nThe pioneering principles established by Charnley were based on the free body analysis of the hip. His primary goals were to minimize the joint reaction force (JRF) and provide low-friction bearing surfaces. To achieve these, Charnley made several modifications:\n- Lateralized the Abductors: By increasing the offset and osteotomizing the greater trochanter (GT) to reposition it more distally and laterally.\n- Medialized the Center of Rotation: Achieved by using a smaller femoral head size, medializing the acetabular cup, and employing thin polyethylene.\nHowever, these changes introduced new challenges:\n- Cup Failure: Thin polyethylene led to insufficient dissipation of force at the cup-bone interface, resulting in loosening and wear. Additionally, cups implanted into soft, cancellous bone were prone to failure.\n\n\nCurrent Recommendations for Acetabular Cups\n\nFixation: Implant the acetabular cup onto the subchondral plate while avoiding excessive medialization.\nCemented Cups: For cemented implants, use 3 large keyholes while preserving the subchondral plate. Modern designs feature grooves and flanges to increase surface area and cement contact. However, avoid deep grooves that may compromise polyethylene thickness.\n\n\n\nFemoral Component Considerations\n\nOffset: Increasing the offset increases the abductor lever arm, which is beneficial. However, increasing neck length (instead of adjusting prosthetic design) transfers more stress to the tip of the implant and the medial cement mantle, leading to potential failure.\nFixation Methods:\n\nUncemented.\nCemented: Ensures both the cement-bone and cement-implant interfaces are firmly fixed (composite beam design).\nTaper-Slip Stem: The cement-bone interface is fixed, but the cement-implant interface is not, allowing for some movement.\n\nStresses at Cement-Bone Interface:\n\nUncemented and Composite Beam Designs: High shear, medium tensile, and low compressive stresses.\nTaper-Slip Stems: Low shear, almost no tensile stress, and high compressive stress due to the viscoelastic properties of cement (e.g., creep and stress relaxation).\n\n\n\n\nBearing Surfaces in THR\nThe choice of bearing surfaces is critical, particularly depending on patient age:\nOlder Patients: Metal-on-polyethylene has a proven track record.\n\nUse polyethylene that has been manufactured using direct compression molding.\nEnsure proper sterilization (gamma irradiation in inert gas) and appropriate storage (vacuum packaging, maximum 2-year shelf life).\nConsider highly cross-linked polyethylene to improve wear resistance.\n\nYounger Patients: Alternative bearing surfaces may be considered based on longevity and wear characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Chromosome Structure and Function\n\nChromosomes are located within each cell’s nucleus.\nTotal of 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs & 2 sex chromosomes.\nComposed of:\n\nDNA\nRNA\nPolysaccharides and proteins\n\nMade up of 2 arms (P and Q).\nArms separated by a constriction called a centromere.\n\n\n\n\nGender\nSex Chromosomes\n\n\n\n\nMale\nXY\n\n\nFemale\nXX\n\n\n\n\nDuring meiosis (cell division that forms sex chromosomes):\n\nMale gives either an X or Y chromosome.\nFemale can only give an X chromosome.\n\n\n\nCell Cycle\nThe cell cycle is relevant to non-sex cells (i.e., those that don’t contain sex chromosomes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nInterphase\nEncompasses the whole cycle except Mitosis. G1, S, and G2 are part of it.\n\n\nG0\nWhen a cell has left the cell cycle (not dividing). Neurons are permanently in G0.\n\n\nG1\nGrowth phase controlled by the p53 gene. Cells increase in size and prepare for synthesis.\n\n\nS\nDNA synthetic phase. Chromosomes divide into chromatids, still contained in one nucleus.\n\n\nG2\nGrowth phase 2. Cell grows post-synthesis, readying for mitosis.\n\n\nM\nMitosis – cell division (not part of interphase). Chromatids are separated into different nuclei. Cell divides (cytokinesis). This is the shortest phase.\n\n\n\n\nDNA - Deoxyribonucleic Acid\n\nA gene is a sequence of DNA arranged in a particular order.\nAround 10,000 genes make up a human genome.\nDNA is composed of:\n\nNitrogenous bases\nPhosphate group\nSugar\n\nThe base is the most important part as it contains the genetic information.\n\n\n\n\nBases\nTypes\n\n\n\n\nPyrimadines\nThymine and Cytosine\n\n\nPurines\nAdenine and Guanine\n\n\n\n\nAdenine is always bonded to Thymine and Guanine to Cytosine.\nDNA is arranged as a double helix.\nHydrogen bonds between bases hold the chains together.\nMitosis is the process whereby cells grow and divide.\n\n\nGenes\n\nMade up of DNA sequences.\nThey code for protein synthesis by transcription (templating of the DNA).\nThe DNA template leaves the nucleus as messenger RNA (mRNA).\nIn the cytoplasm, mRNA combines with other RNA molecules to form proteins on ribosomes (translation).\nTranslating the DNA template into a protein.\nGenotype is the inherited genetic code that produces the phenotype (the physical appearance of the individual).\n\n\nChromosomal Abnormalities\n\nDue to duplication or absence of a whole chromosome or a structural problem with one specific chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nMonosomy\nLoss of one whole chromosome. Survival only possible if the lost chromosome is a sex chromosome (X). Not possible if a non-sex chromosome (autosome) is lost. Patient is termed XO, hence can only be female.\nTurner’s Syndrome\n\n\nTrisomy\nAddition of a whole chromosome. Most common is Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).\nOrthopaedic manifestations: Atlanto-axial instability, Increased SUFE risk, Hyper-laxity especially of patella.\n\n\nStructural\nMay be point mutations, deletion of a large part of a chromosome, or inversion (flipping of a part of the chromosome). All cause incorrect DNA coding & altered expression in the phenotype. Autosomes or sex chromosomes may be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetrance: The degree to which a genotype is expressed in the phenotype. It may be variable (e.g., in Marfan syndrome) and may be incomplete, meaning the genotype is not expressed at all in the phenotype.\n\n\nAlleles\n\nA pair of genes at the same point on the paternal and maternal contribution of the chromosome; therefore, they come as a pair.\nWhen combined, they produce a particular trait.\nIf the alleles are the same, the trait the gene expresses is homozygous.\nIf the alleles are different (i.e., a difference between maternal and paternal contributions), the overall trait expressed is heterozygous.\n\n\nAutosomal Dominant Inheritance\n\nThe gene problem is on the autosomes, not the sex chromosomes; therefore, both males and females can get the disease.\nDominance: The abnormal allele dominates, allowing the abnormality to be expressed.\nThere is a 50% chance of inheritance if one parent is heterozygous for the disease and the other is normal because the trait is dominant.\nIndividuals who are homozygous for the disease are usually so severely affected that they don’t survive.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n\n\nOsteogenesis Imperfecta\n\n\nAchondroplasia\n\n\n\n\nAutosomal Recessive Inheritance\n\nBecause the allele is recessive, it cannot dominate a normal allele.\nTherefore, if a person has the disease, they must be homozygous for the condition (i.e., both alleles are abnormal).\nThose who are heterozygous are carriers but don’t express the phenotype themselves.\nThere is a 25% chance that two parent carriers will produce an affected individual.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSickle cell disease\n\n\nMucopolysaccharidoses\n\n\n\n\nX-Linked Inheritance\n\nThe Y chromosome has very little genetic information, so it does not contribute to disease.\nMen always contribute the Y chromosome to their sons.\nGirls are XX, so there is a contribution from both Mum and Dad.\nX-linked conditions may be dominant or recessive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRecessive\nOnly expressed in girls (Mum and Dad must both be carriers). 50% of boys may have the disease because their X chromosome always comes from Mum (who has 2 X chromosomes). The disease is expressed in boys despite being recessive.\n\n\nDominant\nRare conditions where the abnormal gene is dominant, expressed in those who would have been carriers only. Boys are affected similarly to recessive conditions. Girls who would have been carriers are now affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy\n\n\nHemophilia A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Linked Dominant Condition\n\n\n\n\nHypophosphataemic Rickets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Osteopetrosis (Marble Bone Disease)\n\nOsteopetrosis is characterized by increased bone sclerosis due to deficient osteoclast activity, leading to brittle yet sclerotic bones.\n\nTypes of Osteopetrosis\n\nAutosomal Recessive (Infantile Malignant)\n\nSevere form, often leading to death in infancy.\n\nAutosomal Dominant (Benign)\n\nAlso known as Albers-Schonberg disease.\nTypically diagnosed incidentally after a fracture or X-ray.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of the benign type is usually incidental, especially after fractures or cranial X-rays.\nAdditional findings may include:\n\nAnemia\nCranial nerve palsies, such as hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\nHistology\n\nOsteoclasts lack the typical ruffled border.\nPresence of calcified bars within mature trabeculae.\n\n\n\nX-ray Features\n\nLoss of medullary cavities due to sclerosis.\nBone within a bone appearance.\nSymmetric, uniform sclerosis.\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\nInterferon\nBone marrow transplant for the malignant infantile type.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaget’s Disease of Bone\n\nPaget’s disease is a metabolic disorder involving overactivity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, leading to abnormal bone formation.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMen are slightly more affected.\nCommon in regions such as the USA and UK.\nIncreases with age: affects 3% of people over 40 years and 10% over 80 years.\n\n\n\nTypes\n\nMonostotic: Affects one bone (20% of cases).\nPolystotic: Affects multiple bones (80% of cases).\n\n\n\nCauses\n\nViral-induced: Linked to paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and canine distemper virus.\nGenetic: Some hereditary predisposition.\n\n\n\nPathophysiology\n\nInitial problem lies in osteoclasts, which increase in size and number, becoming overactive.\nOsteoblasts respond by increasing activity, leading to accelerated but disorganized bone formation.\n\n\n\nPhases of Paget’s Disease\n\nLytic Phase: Dominated by osteoclast activity, causing bone lysis.\nActive Phase: Osteoblast activity increases, resulting in mixed sclerotic and lytic areas.\nBurnt-out Phase: Residual effects of the active stage; the bone appears coarse with a mosaic-like trabeculae.\n\n\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nAsymptomatic in 95% of cases, with many diagnoses being incidental.\nFractures: Slower healing fractures, requiring fixation.\nArthritis: Commonly affects the hip and knee, leading to protrusio acetabuli.\nBone Pain: Uncommon but can indicate high turnover or malignancy (e.g., osteosarcoma).\nNerve Compression: Spinal stenosis or hearing loss.\nDeformities: Bowing of long bones (e.g., Sabre tibia).\nCardiac Failure: Due to high vascularity of the bone.\nGout: Due to increased protein metabolism.\nMalignant Transformation: Increased risk of osteosarcoma.\n\n\n\nX-ray Features\n\nWidened bones: A compensatory response.\nPathologic/stress fractures.\nBlade/flame sign: Seen in the lytic stage.\nMosaic-like pattern: Mixed sclerotic and lytic areas.\nDeformities and secondary osteoarthritis.\nHip protrusio: Protrusion of the acetabulum into the pelvic cavity.\n\n\n\nLaboratory Findings\n\nNormal calcium levels.\nElevated alkaline phosphatase: Reflects increased osteoblast activity.\nElevated acid phosphatase: Reflects increased osteoclast activity.\nUrinary collagen peptides and hydroxyproline: Indicate high collagen turnover.\n\n\n\nHistology\n\nMosaic-like bone marrow.\nScanty cells.\n\n\n\nBone Scan\n\nShows high uptake in areas of active disease.\n\n\n\nTreatment Options\nTreatment is indicated for: - Pathologic fractures - Bone pain - Nerve/spinal compression - Osteoarthritis - Cardiac failure due to high output - Gout - Pre-surgery to reduce bleeding risk.\n\nMedical Treatment\n\nBisphosphonates: Inhibits osteoclast overactivity.\nCalcitonin: Less commonly used due to side effects.\n\n\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nFracture fixation is preferred due to long healing times.\nArthroplasty: For joint involvement.\nNerve decompression: In cases of nerve compression.\nMalignant transformation treatment: For osteosarcoma or other sarcomas.\n\n\n\n\nMalignant Transformation\n\n30x increased risk of osteosarcoma, especially in long-standing polystotic disease.\nMay also develop fibrosarcoma or chondrosarcoma.\nPrognosis: 50% survival rate for osteosarcoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Main properties of MOM:\nGood - Fracture toughness - Hard\n- Low surface roughness\n- Small size particle generation (50-100nm)\n- Low biologic activity\n- Macrophage need 0.1 – 0.5 micrometer to be most active\n- Self-Healing\n- Small scratches polished out with articulation\n- Very Resistant to abrasive wear\n- Osteolysis not a major problem\nBad - Produce greater number of particles\n- Especially during initial 2 years\n- Bedding in period after which particle volume plateaus\n- This is greater in implants with greater radial clearance\n\n\nWear mode of MOM Articulations\n\nAdhesive\n\nOvercome by use of alloys with greater carbide (molybdenum)\n\n\n\n\nLubrication in MOM\n\nPredominantly Fluid film lubrication exists in MoM bearings\n\nIn past were equatorial bearing\n\nHigh frictional torque, jamming, high failure\n\n\nNo fluid able to seep into articulation and lubricate\n\nWhen the cup and head are manufactured from the same cast\n\nE.g. original BHR\n\n\nIf pure polar bearing\n\nMuch lower frictional torque\n\nExcessive point contact, stress concentration and wear\n\n\nIdeal is Mid-Polar contact\n\nNeeds a cup head clearance of 90-200 micrometers\n\ni.e. a size mismatch\n\n\n\n\nProblems:\n\nMetal ion dissemination into the blood stream\n\nPotential for carcinogenesis\n\nOccurrence of mettalosis &gt; ALVAL &gt; pseudotumours\n\n\n\nMoM soft tissue problems\n\nMetallosis\n\nMacroscopic staining of the soft tissues\n\n\nALVAL\n\nAseptic Lymphocytic Vasculitis Associated Lesions\n\nHistological diagnosis\n\nMay be present with or without metallosis\n\n\nPseudotumour\n\nCystic/Solid mass lesion\n\nOften has a synovial like bio-membrane\n\nSecretes collagenase, IL-1 and TNF alpha and beta\n\nTherefore can cause osteolysis chemically & mechanical destruction due to size\n\nPresentation\n\nPain\nMass\nDislocation\nNerve compression\n\n\nDiagnosed by imaging or macroscopically\n\nUsually but not always symptomatic\n\n\nARMD\n\nAdverse Reaction to Metal Debris\n\nAn umbrella term for all of the above\n\nAll or only one may be present\n\nMetallosis does not necessarily progress to Pseudotumour formation\n\nMain metal found in tissues is Chromium III\n\nMolybdenum, Cobalt present sporadically\n\n\n\n\nAetiology\n\nTwo main theories:\n\nWear debris related cytotoxicity\n\nHypersensitivity reaction\n\n\n\n\nWear related Cytotoxicity\n\nCaused by component malposition & edge loading\n\nPrimarily increased cup inclination\n\nPreviously thought to occur in a dose dependent local cytotoxic response\n\nBut, retrieval analysis on the ASR shows that a true vasculitis may occur\n\nALVAL can occur in presence of\n\nNormally aligned components\n\nNon MoM articulations\n\n\nTherefore, this is a spectrum where at the most benign end, there is a normal physiological response to metal debris which occurs in all Hip Replacements\n\nProblems occur when the physiologic response is heightened\n\nExcessive metal debris\nPatient related factors – genetics, hypersensitivity etc.\n\n\n\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nTrue Type 4 Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported but are rare\n\nHypersensitivity is thought to be overstated\n\n\n\nLocal Effects of Metal Debris\n\nMetal wear produces higher volume of smaller particles\n\nThese particles has a higher surface area than MoP debris\n\nThis makes it more biologically active\n\nMetal ions especially Cobalt cause cell death once ingested by macrophages\n\nInhibit osteoblastic activity\n\nContributes to the cascade of biological events that result in osteolysis\n\nCause a local immune response of uncertain aetiology\n\n\n\nSystemic Effects of Metal Debris\n\nCirculating metal ion levels increase in MoM articulations\n\nThey vastly increase if the implants are loose or malpositioned\n\nNo proven effect on organ function despite reports of seeding in solid organs\n\nMetal ions are excreted in urine therefore renal failure is a contraindication\n\n\n\nCarcinogenesis\n\nChromium IV is related to causing lung cancer\n\nMeta analysis of over 1 million person years follow up (Onega study)\n\nNo attributable increase in cancer found although some cancers increased and some decreased in frequency\n\nBut we need to be vigilant because\n\nFollow up is relatively short (11yrs)\n\nMalignancy may take up to &gt;30 yrs to develop\n\n\n\n\nTeratogenicity\n\nCommittee on Mutogenicity have reported that internal exposure to metal ions can cause genotoxicity\n\nAnimal studies have shown effect of teratogenicity\n\nMetal ions can cross placenta\n\nNo evidence thus far shown of teratogenicity in humans\n\nBut, implications are severe therefore avoid in young females\n\n\n\nIncidence\n\nDependent on implant type\n\nLess in Resurfacings\n\nMore in female resurfacings – smaller sizes/head-neck ration\n\n\nAsymptomatic incidence estimated at 4%\n\nSymptomatic incidence between 1-5%\n\n\n\nRisk Factors\n\nImplant positioning\n\nPositive correlation by higher inclination angles and revisions with– edge loading\n\nIn vitro studies confirm the increase in metal wear debris\n\nXS anteversion proposed as a cause also but not proven\n\n4X reduction in pseudotumours when alignment within 10 deg of recommended\n\n40 deg inclination and 20 deg anteversion angles in resurfacing\n\n\nImplant size\n\nSmaller sized resurfacing implants have increased wear rate due to impingement\n\nSmaller component sizes in resurfacing shown to increase pseudotumour incidence\n\n\nGender\n\nIncreased Pseudotumour formation in women with MoM articulations\n\nMainly for above reasons\n\n\n\n\nThe ASR\n\nNon-hemispheric cup to increase ROM\n\nResulted in reduced head coverage, edge loading, wear osteolysis and ALVAL\n\nMuch more technically demanding\n\nImplant in the correct position\n\n\n\n\nResurfacing vs THR\n\nTHR MoM implants shown to have higher levels of serum metal ions\n\nTrunion wear and neck cup impingement implicated as cause\n\nTrunion wear made worse by large THR bearings\n\n\n\nSpecific Hip Resurfacing Complications\n\nFemoral Neck Fracture (2%)\n\nRisk factors – patient and surgical dependent factors\n\nFemales\n\nPoorer quality bone\n\nSmaller head Size\n\nMore cement penetration and bone necrosis\n\nSmaller Head size\n\nNeck impingement on cup\n\nHigher risk of notching\n\n\nSuperior neck notching\n\nVarus positioning\n\nLess Surgeon experience – learning curve\n\n\n\nPost operative AVN Avascular Necrosis\n\nExacerbated by\n\nPosterior Approach\n\nThermal necrosis of head\n\nCylindrical reaming of hard bone\n\nDeep cement penetration\n\nPredisposes to neck fracture which is how it usually presents\n\n\n\n\nARMD\n\nUmbrella term for MoM soft tissue problems\n\n\n\nWhen Should THR Components be revised?\n\nSome papers show evidence of progression of metallosis\n\nEarly revision for pseudotumour shown to have better outcome than late revision\n\nLikely due to less soft tissue destruction\n\nEarly revision recommended for these reasons\n\n\n\nResults of Revision\n\nWorse for Pseudotumour than for any other cause of failure\n\nWorse if revision delayed\n\n\n\nHow Long Should MoM Hip Replacements be followed up?\n\nMHRA Guidelines from report published in June 2012\nResurfacing\n\nSymptomatic\n\nMARS scan\nConsider revision if MARS positive and metal ions elevated\n\n\nMetal ion levels\n\nIf &gt;7 ppb then repeat - If rising and still &gt;7ppb consider revision\n\n\nFollow up yearly for life\n\nAsymptomatic\n\nFollow up as per local protocols\n\nNo need for investigation\n\n\n\nMoM THR with head size &lt;36mm\n\nExactly same as resurfacing\n\n\nMoM THR head size &gt;36mm\n\nAll should have metal ion levels\n\nAll should

Worse with tight or strong hamstrings.\n\nParadoxical anterior femoral translation instead of rollback.\n\nPatella Instability: Usually due to component malrotation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating the Painful Knee\n\nHistory, imaging, and blood tests are essential.\nThree broad causes:\n\nInfection/inflammation\nNeurogenic\nMechanical\n\nMechanical Causes:\n\nPatella: Clunk syndrome (scar tissue impinging against the polyethylene post in a PS knee).\nFlexion Instability: Associated with anterior translation of femur in CR knees.\nMalalignment: Varus causes loosening; valgus causes instability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Bone Loss\n\nPre-operative imaging may underestimate bone loss.\nCT scan and intra-operative assessment are better.\nFactors: Size, location, contained or uncontained defects, and potential blood supply to the bone.\nSurgical Principles: Diagnosis, exposure, bone loss, instability, joint line height.\n\n\n\n\nApproach & Exposure\n\nIn multiply operated knees, use the most lateral incision to avoid anterior skin necrosis.\nMedial Parapatellar approach is commonly used.\nExtensile measures: Rectus snip, tibial tubercle osteotomy (avoided if possible).\n\n\n\n\nBone Loss Management\n\nSmall defects: Fill with cement.\nLarger defects: Use particulate bone graft.\nBig defects: Use metallic augments, allografts, or endoprostheses.\nUncontained defects: Likely require metallic augments.\nStem use: Stems help dissipate stress at the bone-implant interface, preventing rapid loosening.\n\nIndicated for instability, protecting bone graft, and dubious metaphyseal fixation.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Constraint\n\nUnconstrained CR or PS: Rare for TKR revision.\nSemi-Constrained PS: Wider, taller post, effective for medio-lateral instability but risks post wear.\nFully Constrained Fixed or Rotating Hinge: Used for very unstable knees with no collateral competence.\n\nRequires more bone resection.\nPrevents hyperextension.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplant Constraints\n\nIncreased constraint is counteracted by:\n\nRotating platform or rotating hinge.\nStemmed implants to dissipate stresses.",

    "text": "Out of the total population of patients with tuberculosis, if we forget the less important organs like head, chest and abdomen, the subset of people with locomotor system TB comes to about 1-2%. Of this 50% is spinal, 15% hip and 10% knee. Rest of the patients will have other joint area or bone involvement.\nThey are predominantly paucibacillary type, meaning, the chances of you finding mycobacteria in specimens is near unlikely. That make the diagnosis difficult and treatment trouble-sum.\n\n\nMy approach to diagnosis is PaTeNDed.\n\nPa-Pain\nTe-Tenderness\nN-Neurology\nDed-Deformity\n\nParticular problem is with pain. Almost all patients come to an orthopaedic surgeon for pain. Our task is to filter out a small portion of organic pain from a big collection of mechanical and somatic pains. One useful rule of thumb is\n\norganic pains increase after a period of rest and are most often associated with rest pain and night pain\n\nThe moment we see such a patient, and especially if associated with localised tenderness, subtle neurological findings or deformity, we have to think about 3 potential diseases\n\nMalignancy\nInfection\nInflammatory diseases\n\nWe should always suspect TB in that situation.\nTB spine can be\n\nPara-diskal –&gt;Arterial spread (most common)\nCentral –&gt; Venous\nAnterior–&gt;Sub-periosteal\nPosterior–&gt;Unstable (rare)\n\nTaking a baseline xray is the first investigation we can quickly do. ESR and CRP has got prognostic values. Contrast enhanced MRI, preferably Gadolinium is the best screening test available. If the MRI picture is suggesting infection, take a biopsy under CT guidance. The specimen should be sent for\n\nHPE\nMycobacterium and other cultures\nNAAT test\nStaining\n\n\n\n\nSpecimen for NAAT should be sent in sterile container, in saline if there is chance of drying. There should be 2 specimens.\nCB-NAAT (Cartridge based) and TRU-NAAT (Card based) are the two types of tests available. Both are recognised by WHO and NTEP for diagnosis of TB. One important point is that the specimen should not contain blood or urine, which can reduce the sensitivity of the test. Overall solid tissue is preferred over liquid. The test, apart from diagnosis, helps in identifying Rifampicin sensitivity. If the speciment is resistant to RIF, send the second sample for Genotypic/phenotypic drug resistant test. LPA (line probe analysis) is a rapid test and can be employed to detect resistance against first and second line drugs.\n\n\n\nThe culture medium of choice is MGIT (Mycobacterium Growth detection Tube). It is prone for contamination, but yields result in 2-4 weeks.

    "text": "Out of the total population of patients with tuberculosis, if we forget the less important organs like head, chest and abdomen, the subset of people with locomotor system TB comes to about 1-2%. Of this 50% is spinal, 15% hip and 10% knee. Rest of the patients will have other joint area or bone involvement.\nThey are predominantly paucibacillary type, meaning, the chances of you finding mycobacteria in specimens is near unlikely. That make the diagnosis difficult and treatment trouble-sum.\n\n\nMy approach to diagnosis is PaTeNDed.\n\nPa-Pain\nTe-Tenderness\nN-Neurology\nDed-Deformity\n\nParticular problem is with pain. Almost all patients come to an orthopaedic surgeon for pain. Our task is to filter out a small portion of organic pain from a big collection of mechanical and somatic pains. One useful rule of thumb is\n\norganic pains increase after a period of rest and are most often associated with rest pain and night pain\n\nThe moment we see such a patient, and especially if associated with localised tenderness, subtle neurological findings or deformity, we have to think about 3 potential diseases\n\nMalignancy\nInfection\nInflammatory diseases\n\nWe should always suspect TB in that situation.\nTB spine can be\n\nPara-diskal –&gt;Arterial spread (most common)\nCentral –&gt; Venous\nAnterior–&gt;Sub-periosteal\nPosterior–&gt;Unstable (rare)\n\nTaking a baseline xray is the first investigation we can quickly do. ESR and CRP has got prognostic values. Contrast enhanced MRI, preferably Gadolinium is the best screening test available. If the MRI picture is suggesting infection, take a biopsy under CT guidance. The specimen should be sent for\n\nHPE\nMycobacterium and other cultures\nNAAT test\nStaining\n\n\n\n\nSpecimen for NAAT should be sent in sterile container, in saline if there is chance of drying. There should be 2 specimens.\nCB-NAAT (Cartridge based) and TRU-NAAT (Card based) are the two types of tests available. Both are recognised by WHO and NTEP for diagnosis of TB. One important point is that the specimen should not contain blood or urine, which can reduce the sensitivity of the test. Overall solid tissue is preferred over liquid. The test, apart from diagnosis, helps in identifying Rifampicin sensitivity. If the speciment is resistant to RIF, send the second sample for Genotypic/phenotypic drug resistant test. LPA (line probe analysis) is a rapid test and can be employed to detect resistance against first and second line drugs.\n\n\n\nThe culture medium of choice is MGIT (Mycobacterium Growth detection Tube). It is prone for contamination, but yields result in 2-4 weeks. But always co-culture in LJ medium to mitigate the problem of contamination.\n\n\n\nPathologists look for\n\nEpitheloid cells\nGranuloma\nLymphocytic infiltration\n\n\n\n\n\nATT- 2HREZ + 10-16 HRE (16 for spine)\nImmobilisation\nSurgery\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurological complications, especially worsening with medical management\nNon neurological complications\n\nNon neurological complications that may warrant surgery include\n\nM- Mass effect, mechanical instability\nD-Deformity\nR-Resistance\n\nTuli classification of Neurology\n\nNot aware of weakness\nAware of weakness\nIn extension\nIn flexion\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly- Assessment of neurology\n3 monthly- X-Rays\n6 monthly- MRI\nFollow-up up to 2 years after completion of treatment",

    "text": "“It takes a child one year to acquire independent movement and ten years to acquire independent mobility. An old person can lose both in a day.” — Professor Bernard Issacs\n\nThe term “geriatric giants” was coined by Professor Bernard Issacs in 1965 to describe a group of conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeriatric giants\n\n\n\n\nimmobility\nincontinence\ninstability and\nimpaired intellect.\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions are considered “giants” due to their high prevalence and the immense burden of suffering they impose on the geriatric population, necessitating medical and social intervention.\n\nOver the years, extensive research has focused on these giants, making them a primary target for geriatricians.\nRecently, Professor Duque and colleagues from the Australian Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences identified an even larger giant: Osteosarcopenia.\nIn a 2021 article published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging, they highlighted the twin problem of Osteosarcopenia. On one hand, it is highly prevalent, and its impact is profound. On the other hand, it has not received the equal recognition and precedence in clinical practice.\nDuring the first decade of our life, we develop a high level of independence and mobility, strongly associated with progressive increases in muscle and bone mass. However, by the third decade, this peak begins to decline. In a significant proportion of older individuals, several risk factors contribute to both Osteoporosis (decreased bone mass with micro-architectural deterioration) and Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass, strength, and function).\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that these two pathological conditions can coexist.\n\nThe term \"Sarco-osteopenia\" was proposed by Binkley and Buehring in 2009 to describe a subset of frail older individuals with osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia.\nThese individuals face a higher risk of falls, fractures, frailty, and morbidity. Later, the term evolved into “Osteosarcopenia”.\nPrevalence estimates for osteosarcopenia range from 5% to 37% among community-dwelling older individuals in various studies conducted in Japan, Iran, Germany, Australia, and China. Unfortunately, there are no published studies from India yet, specifically addressing the prevalence of this condition among the geriatric population.\nAdvancing age is a well-established risk factor for Osteosarcopenia. Other potential risk factors include malnutrition, high body fat, diabetes, depression, physical inactivity, and low educational levels. Researchers propose that short leukocyte telomere length (Kirk et al.) and intermuscular fat infiltration (Al Saedi et al.) contribute to the coexistence of Osteosarcopenia and serve as predictors of falls and fractures.\n\n\nWithout early and prompt interventions, it predisposes older individuals to falls, fractures, disability, frailty, and premature mortality. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which included 30,097 males and females aged 45-85, concluded that osteosarcopenia was associated with falls, fractures, worse life satisfaction, and limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). In 2010 alone, the European Union had 27.5 million people living with osteoporosis, resulting in approximately 3.5 million fragility fractures and a cost exceeding 37 billion euros. These numbers are projected to increase by 25% by 2025. The Hertfordshire trial estimated an annual cost of £2,707 per person, with an overall cost of £2.5 billion in 2018.\nDespite the prevalence of osteoporosis being estimated at 8-62% among Indian women, as reported in a 2023 narrative review by Agarwal et al., there is a noticeable lack of studies from India that describe the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of Osteosarcopenia.\n\n\n\nThis gap in research urgently needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the development and application of accurate diagnostic methods for identifying Osteosarcopenia and predicting associated falls and fractures are of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThere are no screening or risk calculation tools validated for osteosarcopenia. However, numerous tools are available to diagnose both osteoporosis and sarcopenia.\n\n\n\nA 5-point sarcopenia questionnaire recommended in the most recent international consensus guidelines, has limited use as a screening tool due to moderate sensitivity. However, validated tools are available for screening and risk stratification in those with osteoporosis which include the FRAX, widely used and cited.\n\n\n\nDEXA is a specific tool for the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis. According to WHO diagnostic criteria, a t-score of -1 or less classifies the individual as having osteopenia, and -2.5 or less as osteoporosis.\n\n\nThey have established cut-off points for the definitive diagnosis of sarcopenia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWG-SOP 2\n\n\n\n\nAppendicular Skeletal Mass Index (ASMI) &lt; 7.0 kg/m2 in males and &lt;5.5 kg/m2 in females;\nMuscle strength &lt; 27kgf for men and &lt;16 kgf in women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum 25(OH) vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and serum testosterone (in men) can help in detecting most secondary causes of pathology leading to falls and fractures.\n\n\n\nTreatment of osteosarcopenia is not well defined. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of progressive resistance and balance exercises to prevent osteosarcopenia.\nWhey protein, Vitamin D, and Calcium are nutritional supplements that may help in preventing osteosarcopenia.\nPharmacotherapy specifically for osteosarcopenia has not yet been developed. Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, has shown promising effects on bone and muscle.\nIn summary, osteosarcopenia should be identified as a new geriatric giant of our time due to its high prevalence and vast burden of sufferers. Awareness of this condition as a geriatric syndrome should increase, and its prevention, identification, and treatment should become a priority. It should act as a unifier in a set of fragmented fields in which osteoporosis, sarcopenia, falls, and frailty are identified and managed by various specialists. Focused research in this direction could finally improve care for this silent killer.",

    "text": "Fracture type is determined by the force or combination of forces applied.\nCortical bone is stiffer and fractures at a strain of 2%.\n\nRequires higher stress for fracture.\nLess tolerant to deformation but more tolerant to loading.\n\nCancellous bone fractures at a strain of 75%.\nCortical bone is anisotropic (mechanical properties depend on the type of loading).\n\nWeakest in tension and shear.\nStrongest in compression.\n\n\nEnergy transfer:\n- Energy transferred to bone is influenced by mass and velocity: - Formula: ½ M x V² - Velocity has a greater impact than mass.\nBone is viscoelastic: - Properties change with the rate of loading: - Rapid loading: Bone absorbs more energy, becomes stiffer, stronger, and more brittle, which leads to fracture.\nFactors determining fracture type: - Energy and rate of loading. - Direction of force. - Bone properties (shape, cortical thickness, pathologies). - Soft tissue forces (e.g., avulsion fractures).\n\nFracture Types\n\nOblique Fracture: Caused by pure shear force or uneven bending, leading to oblique cracking of osteons.\nTransverse Fracture: Due to pure tensile bending force (2% strain for cortical bone).\n\nResults in de-bonding of cement lines and osteon pullout (e.g., patella, olecranon).\n\nButterfly Fracture: Occurs on the compression side when there is combined tension (bending) and compression.\nSpiral Fracture: Result of torsion, typically at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal.\nSegmental Fracture: Often caused by 4-point bending (e.g., car bumper vs. tibia).\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Bone Healing\n\nRequires absolute stability and rigid fixation under compression, creating a low-strain environment.\nHealing occurs via intra-membranous ossification.\n\nSequence of Healing: 1. Contact Healing: - Minimal initial activity at contact sites. 2. Gap Healing: - Blood vessels grow into small gaps, bringing cells. - Mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts, laying down lamellar bone in small gaps or woven bone in larger gaps. 3. Cutting Cones: - Osteoclasts form cutting cones, tunneling across the fracture. - Channels are left for vascular and osteoblast invasion. 4. Remodeling: - Lamellar bone is laid down, leading to bridging callus and new osteon formation. - Remodeling continues for months.\n\n\n\nSecondary Bone Healing\n\nRequires relative stability and some degree of strain.\nHealing occurs by two processes:\n\nPeriosteal callus (intramembranous ossification).\nEndosteal callus (endochondral ossification).\n\n\nHealing occurs in three locations: 1. Endosteal surface (bridging fibrous callus). 2. Surrounding soft tissues (bridging fibrous callus). 3. Periosteum (bony callus).\nPeriosteal Callus: - Bone is produced directly without cartilage formation. - Osteoblasts lay down type 1 collagen. - Does not bridge the fracture and won’t form if there’s excessive periosteal stripping.\nBridging Callus: - Forms between bone ends (endosteal) and in soft tissues. - Fibrocartilage forms first, which is then calcified into woven bone (soft callus) and finally consolidated into hard callus.\n\n\nFive-Stage Process of Bone Healing\n\nHaematoma (hours):\n\nTissue damage causes clot formation, leading to platelet degradation and release of PDGF.\nPDGF activates the clotting cascade and cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1, attracting immune cells and activating bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).\n\nInflammation (up to a week):\n\nBMPs stimulate angiogenesis and are osteogenic.\nMacrophages clean up necrotic debris, and fibroblasts start forming granulation tissue.\n\nSoft Callus (4 weeks):\n\nReduced strain (15%) allows chondroblasts to lay down type 2 collagen, forming a cartilage scaffold (endochondral ossification).\n\nHard Callus (4-16 weeks):\n\nCartilage is replaced with woven bone by osteoblasts, stabilizing the fracture.\n\nRemodeling (years):\n\nWoven bone is remodeled into lamellar bone in response to mechanical stresses (Wolff’s Law).\n\n\n\n\n\nWolff’s Law\n\nBone adapts and remodels according to mechanical stresses:\n\nOsteoblasts predominate on the concave compression side.\nOsteoclasts dominate on the convex tension side.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Bone Healing\n\nThe goal is always to achieve primary bone healing.\nIn a low-strain environment, primary healing happens immediately.\nIn higher strain environments, sequential tissue types form:\n\nClot\nGranulation tissue\nCartilage\nWoven bone\nLamellar bone\n\n\n\n\nPerren’s Strain Theory\n\nTissue formation at the fracture site is dictated by the degree of interfragmentary strain.\nStrain reduction improves healing:\n\n100% strain forms granulation tissue.\n10% strain forms fibrocartilage (soft callus).\n5% strain forms woven bone (hard callus).\n&lt;2% strain allows primary bone healing.\n\n\nProblems in Healing: - Too little strain or large residual gaps can lead to non-union. - Too much strain can prevent hard callus formation, leading to hypertrophic non-union or pseudoarthrosis.\n\n\n\nAdverse Effects on Fracture Healing\n\nBlood supply is critical.\nSmoking (nicotine) and NSAIDs can impair healing.\nHead injury may increase blood flow, leading to excessive callus formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

RCTs show it to be better than ACI, although others have shown the opposite.\nResults may deteriorate over time.\nRemains a safe, easy first-line option with reasonable results, good to excellent results in around 2/3 of patients.\n\n\n\n\nOsteochondral Grafting - Autograft (Mosaicoplasty)\n\nUse of multiple osteochondral plugs harvested from non-articular parts of the same knee to fill the defect. Produces a congruent, viable, and durable option.\nKey Technical Points:\n\nPack cylinders closely to avoid large gaps.\nUse cylinders of the same depth as the holes to prevent loosening/subsidence.\nCreate a congruent surface.\n\nAdvantages: Autologous, hyaline cartilage, single operation, low recovery time.\nDisadvantages: Technical challenge, graft site morbidity, limited volume available.\nOutcomes:\n\nGood: 80% good or excellent at 36 months.\nTwo RCTs show better improvement than ACI, although all improved, and even some with debridement alone improved.\n\n\n\n\nOsteochondral Grafting - Allograft\n\nUse of fresh (frozen denatured chondrocytes) allograft to fill defects.\nThe graft is harvested fresh and stored in Hartmans or culture fluid in the fridge (4 degrees). The allograft bone is necrotic and is replaced by creeping substitution, providing a scaffold for cartilage incorporation.\nThe cartilage itself, being fairly avascular, resists immune reactions.\nAdvantages: No graft site morbidity, very good for large lesions, excellent congruency, hyaline cartilage.\nDisadvantages: Poor availability of allograft, expensive, technically demanding, immune/infection risk.\nOutcomes: Long-term graft survival has been shown with good results in case series, but no good evidence that this is better than other modalities.\n\nOther types of allograft, such as fresh frozen and cryopreserved, are inferior in quality due to the denaturing of the chondrocytes and are not recommended.\n\n\n\n\nChondrocyte Implantation - Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI)\n\nHarvesting of host chondrocytes, growth in vivo, and re-implantation into defect. Potentially the best option as host hyaline cartilage is formed.\nAdvantages: Hyaline cartilage formed with potential for best longevity.\nDisadvantages: Two operations needed, not available everywhere, long process, technically demanding.\nOutcomes:\n\nRCTs have shown mixed results, but several show superiority over microfracture and mosaicplasty. However, these treatments also gave good results in the same trials.\n\n\n\n\nChondrocyte Implantation – Matrix Associated Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI)\n\nChondrocytes are incorporated into a porcine collagen membrane, which gives a more even cell distribution and makes placement of the cells easier.\nShown good results, some better than ACI, although disadvantages are similar.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nConflicting evidence for more advanced techniques with benefits from ‘lesser’ methods. Therefore, first-line treatment should be microfracture/mosaicplasty for standard lesions and situations.",
