Expertise has become superspecialized and technological in its nature, so students have to learn clinical skills from scores of teachers. As attachments have become more numerous, they have become shorter and the number of learners has increased, so education has become less personal. Traditional bedside teaching skills have decayed as each generation is less exposed to them.New educational technologies such as skills training and problem-based learning have brought education within the control of the objective-driven curriculum by substituting simulation for reality. All that sounds depressingly like the curriculum ‘without the personal influence of [clinical] teachers upon pupils’ that Osler likened to an Arctic winter.\nThis is bewildering for any medical teacher worth his salt.\nTwo classic papers that help us to trace the roots of this situation and the potential vaccine for it (the Early Clinical Exposure) are those written by Tim Dornam FRCP and Okay Basak et al",

He thoroughly analyses the contributions of these two giants and suggested that the wheel has come full circle. Osler introduced a clerkship system that gave students a role in the clinical service.\n\nDisease, in his view, was the student’s chief teacher, and teaching should be at the bedside rather than in the lecture hall.

My score was 40%. I bought Miller’s Review of Orthopaedics and started learning. I spent nearly 5-6 hours reading Miller/attempting Orthobullets questions. My strategy was to read Miller as much as I can and as quickly as possible so as to revise at-least 3-4 times. My strategy for Orthobullets questions was similar. My target was 150-200 questions per day, with 3-4 revisions before exam. 1 month before the Part I exam, I bought paid questions in the Orthobullets and BMJ OnExamination which I believe, though expensive, gave me an extra edge and confidence.\n\n\nMiller’s review of orthopaedics latest edition, page-to-page, 4 revisions\nOrthobullets free questions, 3 revisions\nOrthobullets paid questions\nBMJ OnExamination\nTotal 5-6 months preparation spending 5-6 hours on an average daily.\n\n\n\nJust like any other examination in the past, I reached the city 1 day prier to the exam date.

Total duration of the exam was 5 hours (2 hours SBA, 2 hours 30 minutes EMQ, 30 minutes break in between).

In other situations with bigger gaps in between the fractured ends, they heal by secondary intention, which is called secondary healing. This effect of gap on the fracture healing process is due to its affect on the strain which is called fracture gap strain which is given by the formula ∆FGap/FGap as described by Perrin.\n\nStrain is the deformation of a material when a given force is applied.\nFracture gap stain is the ratio of relative displacement of fracture ends versus initial fracture gap width.\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing. The strain will be less-\n\nWith large fracture area (less ∆FGap)\nMore number of fracture fragments.\nLess gap in between the fracture fragments.\n\n\nStrain and bone healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrain\nType of tissue formed\nType of healing\nStability\n\n\n\n\n100\nGranulation\n*\nAbsolute instability\n\n\n17\nFibrous tissue\n*\nUnstable\n\n\n2-10\nFibrocartilage\n20 healing\nRelative stability\n\n\n&lt;2\nLamellar bone\n10 healing\nAbsolute stability\n\n\n\nPercentage of strain determines the type of tissue formed during the healing.\n\n\nPrimary bone healing.\n\nCortical bone\nCortical bone heals by Osteonal remodeling by Osteonal cutting cones if there is no gap. This requires\n\nabsolute stability (with strain &lt; 2%)\nNo gap\nViable bone ends\n\n\nIf there is gap but &lt; 500µm, healing is by gap healing. In gap healing, osteoblast lays down sequential layers of bone to close the gap.\n\n\nCancellous bone.\nHeals primarily by a mechanism called bony ingrowth. Here revascularisation followed by osteoblasts laying down new bone.\n\n\n\nBone ingrowth in cancellous bone\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\nHam in 1930 published a description of early phases of bone healing after studying fractured rabbit fibulae and ribs. Phases of bone healing was more fully described by McKibbin in 1978. In simple terms, bone heals in 3 phases, like any other tissue.\n\n\n\nSecondary bone healing\n\n\n\n\nPhases of bone healing\n\nInflammation\nCellular proliferation and differentiation\nRemodeling.\n\nHowever the process is complicated by high specialisation and calcified nature of bone.\nDifferentiation of primitive mesenchymal stem cells in to cells with osteogenic potential result in a specialized connective tissue formation called callus. Ambient strain stimulate fracture gaps to form callus . For this the strain environment should be 2%-10%. Bio-mechanical function of the callus is to reduce strain by\n\nincreasing the diameter of the fractured area.\nIncreasing the stiffness.\n\n\nSoft and Hard callus.\nSoft callus: Central, due to endochondral ossification.\nHard callus: Peripheral, due to intramembranous ossification",

Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested.\n\nNow what is this?\nThis funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones.\nTwo possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.\n\nIf so, what is this?\nThe funnel plot displays the % of observed 30-day mortality rate of operations on the Y-axis and the total number of operations on the X-axis. A practice lying on the line Y=1 has a surgeon performing close to average, whereas a practice lying above Y=1 has a the total number of operations that is higher than the average.\nImportant point\nFunnel plot is used to detect publication bias as well as outliers\n\nFunnel plot\n\nFunnel plot concepts\nIt is a representation of SEM plotted against the true population mean or the no effect line of a study in a graph. Smaller studies tend to have larger SEM and the larger studies will have smaller SEM. Hence the plot assumes a funnel shape. I an ideal world, funnel plot is supposed to form a symmetrical “funnel”. This is not the case in real world, because of various reasons.\n\n\n\nUses of funnel plot\nTo identify outliers. Eg: A surgical resident’s performance\nTo identify the validity of a meta-analysis. An asymmetrical funnel plot suggests a potential problem with the results of the meta-analysis.\n\n\nCauses of asymmetrical funnel plot\n\nReporting bias\n\nReporting bias\n\nPublication bias: Delayed reporting, language bias, duplication)\nSelective outcome reporting\nSelective analysis reporting\n\n\nPoor methodology\n\nDesign\nAnalysis\nFraud\n\nHeterogeneity\nChance\n\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nVariations over and above that is expected by chance\npredicts whether the data from different studies can be combined for meta-analysis to obtain a forest plot.\n\nCauses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical\nStatistical\n\n\n\n\nDifference in the population\nIndividual results are inconsistent\n\n\nDifference in the study design\nDifference in size of benefit\n\n\nDifference in intervention\nDifference in size of harm\n\n\nDifference in outcome\n\n\n\nAlways present\n\n\n\nCannot be statistically evaluated\nCan be evaluated statistically\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting Heterogeneity\n\nReview the table describing individual studies\n“eye ball test”, review the forest plot\nReview the statistical tests\nStatistical tests\nStatistical tests for detecting heterogeneity\n\n\n\nTests for its presence:\nChi Square test, p&gt;0.1 means study is homogenous\n\n\nTest to quantify:\nI2\nIt measures the % of heterogeneity\n\n≤25%=low\n50%= moderate\n≥75%= high)\n\n\n\nAnalysis of cause of heterogeneity\nOnce heterogeneity is identified and quantified, he have to analyse and find out why it is present\nThis is done by\n\nsubgroup analysis\nMeta regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

An old person can lose both in a day.” — Professor Bernard Issacs\n\nThe term “geriatric giants” was coined by Professor Bernard Issacs in 1965 to describe a group of conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeriatric giants\n\n\n\n\nimmobility\nincontinence\ninstability and\nimpaired intellect.\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions are considered “giants” due to their high prevalence and the immense burden of suffering they impose on the geriatric population, necessitating medical and social intervention.\n\nOver the years, extensive research has focused on these giants, making them a primary target for geriatricians.\nRecently, Professor Duque and colleagues from the Australian Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences identified an even larger giant: Osteosarcopenia.\nIn a 2021 article published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging, they highlighted the twin problem of Osteosarcopenia. On one hand, it is highly prevalent, and its impact is profound. On the other hand, it has not received the equal recognition and precedence in clinical practice.\nDuring the first decade of our life, we develop a high level of independence and mobility, strongly associated with progressive increases in muscle and bone mass. However, by the third decade, this peak begins to decline. In a significant proportion of older individuals, several risk factors contribute to both Osteoporosis (decreased bone mass with micro-architectural deterioration) and Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass, strength, and function).\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that these two pathological conditions can coexist.\n\nThe term \"Sarco-osteopenia\" was proposed by Binkley and Buehring in 2009 to describe a subset of frail older individuals with osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia.\nThese individuals face a higher risk of falls, fractures, frailty, and morbidity. Later, the term evolved into “Osteosarcopenia”.\nPrevalence estimates for osteosarcopenia range from 5% to 37% among community-dwelling older individuals in various studies conducted in Japan, Iran, Germany, Australia, and China. Unfortunately, there are no published studies from India yet, specifically addressing the prevalence of this condition among the geriatric population.\nAdvancing age is a well-established risk factor for Osteosarcopenia. Other potential risk factors include malnutrition, high body fat, diabetes, depression, physical inactivity, and low educational levels. Researchers propose that short leukocyte telomere length (Kirk et al.) and intermuscular fat infiltration (Al Saedi et al.) contribute to the coexistence of Osteosarcopenia and serve as predictors of falls and fractures.\n\n\nWithout early and prompt interventions, it predisposes older individuals to falls, fractures, disability, frailty, and premature mortality. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which included 30,097 males and females aged 45-85, concluded that osteosarcopenia was associated with falls, fractures, worse life satisfaction, and limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). In 2010 alone, the European Union had 27.5 million people living with osteoporosis, resulting in approximately 3.5 million fragility fractures and a cost exceeding 37 billion euros. These numbers are projected to increase by 25% by 2025. The Hertfordshire trial estimated an annual cost of £2,707 per person, with an overall cost of £2.5 billion in 2018.\nDespite the prevalence of osteoporosis being estimated at 8-62% among Indian women, as reported in a 2023 narrative review by Agarwal et al., there is a noticeable lack of studies from India that describe the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of Osteosarcopenia.\n\n\n\nThis gap in research urgently needs to be addressed.

    "text": "Recommended Text books\nFrom a plethora of expensive Orthopaedic textbooks of varying size, shape and quality, it is difficult to select a perfect book or two. It is better to acknowledge the fact that the nature of the exam is diverse and there is no quick and easy remedy.\n\nMiller’s Review of Orthopaedics 7th edition.\nComing with a punchy tag line, go-to certification and recertification review guide for every orthopaedic resident, fellow, and surgeon, this book divides people in to two-Those who believe in Miller’s review and those who do not! It’s strong point is compactness and intensiveness; same is its weakness. It’s basic science, Arthroplasty and Statistics chapters are industry standard. I cleared the Part 1 studying mainly(95%) Miller and Orthobullet question bank. If allowed to grade as per FRCS Part 2 marking system, I will give 7/8 for this book when used for Part 1. Its usefulness for Part 2 as an exclusive guide is at the best doubtful. I cannot comment on the more recent 8^th edition.\n\n\nPostgraduate Orthopaedics, the candidate’s guide and Viva guide\nSelection of Part 2 book is relatively simpler. This book series stands apart. I doubt whether you can pass the Part 2 without going through these 2 books. Apart from the top class content, they drill in higher order thinking and caters to even more advanced students of orthopaedics. It is impossible to grade this book. Prof. Paul Banaszkiewicz has done a work of genius.\n\n\nDo you have any proof?\nLet’s try to learn a topic from these two books: Funnel plot\nMiller’s Review 7th edition: The topic is not covered.\n\nPostgraduate Orthopaedics:\nBoth Candidate’s guide and the viva guide beautifully discusses the funnel plot. Let me quote a few lines from them.\n\nCandidates guide\n\n“Funnel plots are used to compare outcomes in groups of different sizes. It was seen in the section on SEM that with increasing sample size the SEM approaches zero; where this does not occur it is likely that some effect is being observed. This can be used to detect ‘ outliers ’*\n\n\nIn outcome studies, such as when comparing mortality rates for different surgical centres or surgeons Inverted funnel plots can be used to detect publication bias; the SEM should be larger for studies with smaller sample sizes – If it is not this may indicate publication bias. ……….; if there is an effect of the intervention there will be a shift of the data points to the left but there should still be a greater scatter of results for the studies with a larger SEM. The plot on the left shows no such increase in scatter with increasing SEM, suggesting publication bias(two funnel plots are shown)”\n\n\n\nViva Guide\n\n“This is called a funnel plot which is a simple scatterplot of the treatment effects (RR) estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against the precision of the studies represented by standard error (SE). The vertical dotted line shows the estimated combined RR from the meta-analysis. The diagonal dotted lines show the range in which studies might be distributed by chance given the size (and thus precision) of each study. Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested. The funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones. Two possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.” You would appreciate the difference the moment you read a lesser book.\n\n\n\nConcise Orthopaedic notes\nRecently Firas Arnaout of FRCS Mentor group contacted me and suggested me to read his recently revised book, Concise Orthopaedic Notes . He kindly gave me free assess to the digital version. I thank him for the gesture, even though, as a kindle unlimited member, I had already rented and read some chapters of his book before. Authors believe that they have covered the depth and width of knowledge and skills required for the exam and challenge anyone to find an FRCS question that has not been included in the book. This book is a welcome edition and with some hard work, it can even compete with Miller’s review to some extent, for Part 1.\nLet’s see what does the book tell us about funnel plot.\n\n“Performance measuring tool used to measure variations in performance between surgeons and/or centres and identify outliers (Above red line)\nThey are scatter plots, with superimposed control limits (typically 2 SD, 3 SD or 4 SD)\nShows 90-day mortality following hip surgery\nSurgeon/hospital highlighted as orange triangle\nThe smaller the size of the sample, the wider the control limits (increased variability).\nAs the sample increases the certainty increases and the ‘funnel’ is formed.\nProgression along horizontal axis means that surgeon/hospital done more cases\nData within the control limits (between the dotted lines) are consistent with common cause variation or natural variation, whereas those outside these limits indicate unexpected good or bad results (outliers)\nFor mortality, it means they done higher risk patients\nCan’t identify someone doing very few cases (towards left side of graph) as outlier.\nProgression along vertical axis means surgeon/hospital have had more of the end point (revision or death) deaths.\nVertical axis figures presented as standardized ratio.\nFor mortality - data adjusted to take account of surgeons who operate on more higher-risk or lower-risk patients.\nSurgeons on central (green) horizontal line have had exactly average expected mortality.\nSurgeons either side of green line but below upper red line have level of mortality that is within expected range.\nSurgeons that appear above top red line have mortality rate higher than expected. This is followed by a picture of funnel plot.”\n\nAfter reading this I am more confused than confident",

Examinations and is recognised by GMC for Speciality registration.\n\n\n\nExamination Pattern\nThe current International FRCS (Tr & Orth) exam encompasses two sections: Part I is a written exam and Part II the clinical and oral exam. For further information, and to make sure that your information is up to date, I suggest that you carefully review the Intercollegiate Speciality Board website.This is the link.\n\nPart I\nThis section consists of two separate papers ( a Computer Based Testing-CBT); essentially, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) paper (2 Hours) and an extended matching question (EMQ) paper (2 hours 30 minutes). Part I is generally regarded as the easier section of exam to pass. A number of candidates may be OK learning for an MCQ/EMI paper but be a long way off the standard for a clinical and viva exam.\nFormat of Section 1 examination changes from 2021\nThe GMC has approved an alteration to the format of the Section 1 examination. The following format is applicable to all Section 1 examinations from January 2021:\nPaper 1 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)\nPaper 2 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)\n\n\n\nHow to apply\nhttps://www.jscfe.co.uk is the official website for registering and applying for the examination. It costs £520.00 for Part I application and £1,785.00 for Part II. To apply,\n\n\nApplicants must be six years medically qualified\nApplicants would normally have passed the MRCS examination of one ofthe four Surgical Royal Colleges but this is currently not mandatory\nApplicants must have successfully completed a locally recognised surgical training programme and are required to provide evidence of having achieved the required standard of a recognised specialist (day one NHS UK/Ireland consultant standard) in the generality of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery\nThis evidence must consist of three structured references as follows:\nThe principal referee must be the applicant’s current of Head of Department or Head of the Recognised Training Committee/Programme in which the applicant has participated.\nThe second referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years\nThe third referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years\nThe final decision on eligibility for admission to the examination will lie with the Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination Specialty Board in Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery\nExamination Attempts:\nCandidates will have up to a maximum of 7 years to complete the examination process as follows:\nSection 1:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry\nSection 2:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry",

Traditionally procedures skills are taught using a ‘‘see one - do one’’ approach. This is referred to as Halsted’s teaching approach, which is based on the surgeon Halsted (1904). Recently two new teaching approachs for the acquisition of procedural skills were described.\nA stepwise Skill teaching approach was presented by George in the meeting of American College of Surgeons, 1997 and later published by George & Doto in 2001. Originally, it was developed as an educational technique to support the American College of Surgeon’s Advanced Trauma Life Support course. George and Doto used five steps. They based their teaching approach on Simpson’s taxonomy of the psychomotor domain (Simpson, 1966) . The steps are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimpson\n\n\n\n\nOverview: Why and how the skill is important\ndemonstration\nThe preceptor then repeats the procedure\nStudents talk through the skill\nperformance.\n\n\n\nIf students have a problem learning a skill, the preceptor will need to identify which of the following reasons may be underlying their performance deficit.\n\nLearner Trait Ability\n\nLearner trait ability is the inherent inability of the learner to perform the task because the learner may not possess the strength, fine motor coordination, or the fine motor skills necessary to do the task.\n\nInadequate/Inappropriate Task Description and/or Demonstration\nImprinting of Previous Incorrect or Obsolete Performance\nImproper Correction/ Reinforcement\nAffective Factors\nInaccurate Learner Perception of Performance\n\nIf the preceptor recognizes any of these problems, corrective actions can be initiated. Skill teaching need not be a time-intensive process if the preceptor will learn this quick and easy five-step method. While going through these five steps may seem lengthy, the result is that the preceptor will spend less time observing and corrrecting performance problems and will ensure a better learning environment.\nPeyton’s teaching approach is also a stepwise method with following four steps: :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeyton\n\n\n\n\ndemonstration\ndeconstruction\ncomprehension and\nperformance.\n\n\n\nWithin Peyton’s teaching approach, two of the five steps are collated into a single step.\n\nVideo showing Mr. J.W.
