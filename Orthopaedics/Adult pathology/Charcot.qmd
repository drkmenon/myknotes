## Charcot

#### Definition

<font color="emerald">It is a non infectious,destructive process culminating in dislocations and periarticular fractures in patients with peripheral neuropathy and loss of protective sensations</font>

0.1 to 29% incidence

50% need one operation in life time

15-67% chance of amputation

#### Clinical features

-   Pain
-   Local rise of temparature >3-5<sup>0</sup> compared to normal
-   Swelling
-   Deformity

#### Cahrcot vs Infection

| Charcor                               | Infection                                  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Limb elevation decreases inflammation | No                                         |
| No                                    | Increased ESR,CRP,IL6                      |
| No                                    | Istope (In +Tc)scan positive, PET positive |

#### Classification

##### Eichenholtz

| Stage | Name             | Features                |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 0     | Prefragmentation | Inflammation            |
| 1     | Fragmentation    | Subluxation,dislocation |
| 2     | Coalascence      | decreased inflammation  |
| 3     | Consolidation    | No inflammation         |

#### Progression

0-1 in 6 months and 2-3 in 12-14 months

#### Causes

-   Endocrine: DM, Renal failure, Alcohol
-   Infection: Leprosy, syphilis
-   Neurogenic: CP, Syrinx,Myelomeningocele, cord injury
-   Idiopathic

#### Theories

-   Neurotraumatic
-   Neurovascular ( **Autonomic dysfunction causing bone resorption**)
-   Inflammatory theory (**Favored, Here injury lead to inflammation and activate RANK-RANKL pathway leading to bone resorption**)
-   ADA, 2011 suggests a hybrid of all theories

#### Clinical examination

##### Look

Stand the patient and look for deformity. Most common are **Rocker bottom and Planovalgus**

Walk the patient and look for Clawing and also have a look at the foot wear

Sit the patient and look for deformity, ulceration and inflammation

##### Feel

Temperature, tenderness, pulse and sensation

##### Move

The joints

##### Special tests

SilfverskiÃ¶ld test, Vibration, **offer probing the ulcer**

#### management principles

1.  Stop inflammation
2.  Protect and maintain foot architecture
3.  Relieve pain
4.  Arrest or reverse de-mineralisation
5.  Prevent/limit deformity
6.  Control DM

> Suspect Charcot if there is a deformity associated with inflammation, perepheral neuropathy with or without renal failure

> Suspected a/c Charcot: always take a weight bearing X Ray, if negative take MRI

> Immediatly refer to MDT

#### MDT approach

1.  Non removable offloading device
2.  **No Bisphosphonates**
3.  Monitor by Foot Skin temperature assessment and seriel xrays until inflammation resolves

#### When will you say that inflammation is resolved?

-   Temperature difference of \< $2^0$ between the feet
-   Seriel xrays show no progression
