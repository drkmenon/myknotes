## **Osteoporosis**

**Definitions:**

`Decrease in bone mass with microarchitectural deterioration` 

![*Total mass of bone is reduced without change in composition*](images/Ospop2.png)

The ratio between the minaralised and non mineralised bone is unchanged

**WHO definition:**

`Post menapausal women and men above 50 years, with Bone Mineral Density that lies 2.5 SD (T score) or more below the average value for young healthy caucaseous female.`

Normal: \< -1.0 t-score

Osteopenia: b/w -1 and -2.5 t-score

Osteoporosis: t-score -2.5 or less

Severe: Osteoporosis + One or more fracture

In premenapausal women and men below 50 years, z score should be used and densitometric findings alone should not be used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis

Types of Osteoporosis

-   Primary

-   Secondary

z-score is used to diagnose 2⁰ Osteoporosis. in z-score, average value taken is from Sex, Age and Race (SAR) matched population.

For DEXA, central (AP of spine between L1 and L4 vertebrae) is used. Lateral can include ribs causing false negative results. Peripheral DEXA is not used because of confounding variables causing 2⁰ osteoporosis and affects of treatment on BMD.

False Negative results: Arthritis (Osteophytes and sclerosis)

False Positive results: Laminectomy

## **FRAX**

FRAX is a fracture risk assessment tool developed by international osteoporosis foundation to assess 10 year vertebral and neck of femur fracture risk.

FRAX can be used in \>41 year old males and post menapausal females.

## **RISK FACTORS FOR OSTEOPOROSIS**

-   General: Age, sex, low BMI

-   Comorbidity: previous fractures

-   Social: Smoking, Alcohol

-   Family history of hip fractures

## **Treatment**

Non pharmacological:

-   Protein rich diet

-   Sunlight

-   Resistance exercise

Pharmacological

-   Antiresorptive treatment

-   Bone forming treatment

## **Anti resorptive treatment**

-   Bisphosphonates: Zoledronic acid is the primary drug of choice

-   Calcium and Vitamin D3: No level 1 evidence, but helps preventing falls

-   HRT

-   SERM: Raloxifen

-   Calcitonin: For vertebral pain, drug of choice

## **Bone forming**

-   PTH intermittent

-   Anabolic steroids
