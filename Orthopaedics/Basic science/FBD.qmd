**Free body diagram**: `A special type of vector diagram used to study the magnitude and direction of forces acting on body`

## **Newtons laws of motion**

The entire concept of FBD revolves around the the following laws:

-   Every body continue to be in rest or motion unless acted upon by external force.

-   F= MA

-   For every force there is an equal and opposite force.

## **What is weight?**

-   Weight is a force

-   Mass x Gravity = F , Kg m/s²=N

-   This means a 70kg person will have a weight of 700N

-   This is not important for day to day practice

## **Levers**

Lever is a machine designed to move objects

It has got a bar and a fulcrum.

3 classes of levers

-   Class 1

    ![](images/1.png){width="350"}

    e.g.: see-saw, scissors

    Hipjoint

-   Class 2

    ![](images/2.png){width="350"}

    e.g.: Stapler, Doors

    Knee joint in flexion

-   Class 3

![](images/3.png){width="350"}

e.g.: Broom

Jaw, Forearm in flexi

## **Vector**

![](images/4.png){width="150"}

It is the diagrammatic representation of force. Has got magnitude and direction

## **Moment**

![](images/5.png){width="400"}

A force applied at a distance from pivot point will cause segment to rotate. The distance is called moment arm and the rotational effect is called turning moment.

Turning moment = F x moment arm

Turning moment is also called torque.

**F x d = Turning Moment or torque**

## **Assumptions**

-   FBD is a 2d simplification of a 3d structure

-   We are using vectors and moments

-   Body we draw should be in equilibrium

-   Bones are rigid rods

-   Joints are frictionless hinges

-   There are no antagonistic muscles

-   Fore act through the centre of muscle

-   Muscle act only through tendon

-   JRF is always compressive

## **Hip FBD**

![](images/6.png){width="350"}

**Abductor moment = body moment in equilibrium**

Fd = w x 5d

F = 5w

\*w is generally taken as 5/6 of the body weight as the person is standing on one leg. Weight of one leg is generally taken a 1/6 body weight.

\*F is the abductor force of contraction.

JRF

## **How to reduce JRF in hip?**

**Carry weight on same side!**

![](images/8.png){width="400"}

**F x d + F' x 2d = w x 5d**

**F + F' = 5w**

**F = 5w - F'**

So the abductor force of contraction required is reduced from F to F-2F'

**Carry stick on the opposite side!**

![](images/9.png){width="450"}

Pressing the stick on to the ground will produce an equal and opposite ground reaction force, s.

**F x d = w x 5d - s x 10d**

**F = 5w - 10s**

So the abductor force of contraction required is reduced from F to F-10s

## **Ankle FBD**

It is important to keep the ankle in dynamic equilibrium

![](images/10.png){width="400"}

This essentially make ankle a reverse hip joint, another type one lever

![](images/11.png){width="500"}

**F x d = w x 3d**

F = 3 w

## **JRF ankle**

## **Spine FBD**

Assume a man bending forward and trying to take a brick. Here the motion segment is again acting as a type 1 lever.

## **JRF Spine**

## 

![](images/14.png){width="300"}

## **Cervical Spine FBD**

![](images/15.png){width="400"}

**F x d = w x d**

**F = w**

## **Patello femoral joint FBD**

![](images/16.png){width="700"}

The quadriceps and patellar tendon are in equilibria, with a force 4F on either direction. The JRF is less than 4F. JRF is maximum when in flexion and negligible in extension of knee joint.

## **Knee joint FBD**

![](images/17.png)

We can see that when a person is about to raise from a chair, knee joint acts as a second order lever. Weight is acting down from the middle of the thigh and the quadriceps force F is directed towards the knee.

## **Shoulder joint FBD**

![](images/18.png){width="350"}

Here we can see that shoulder is a third order lever.

## **Elbow and fingers FBD**
