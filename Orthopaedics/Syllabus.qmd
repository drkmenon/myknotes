Orthopaedics is a branch of modern Medicine that deals with congenital and acquired disorders of the musculo-skeletal system. Considering the advances in management modalities and increased trauma incidence, basic preliminary knowledge of Orthopaedics must be acquired at the MBBS level.

As an undergraduate trainee, students are expected to know common orthopaedic illnesses and ailments with respect to their etiopathogenesis, diagnostic clinical features, and basic management modalities. They should also learn the principles and techniques of bracing, splinting, and traction.

## Course Outcome

### Knowledge

At the end of the course, the student shall be able to:

1. Explain the principles of recognition of bone injuries and dislocation.  
2. Apply suitable methods to detect and manage common infections of bones and joints; learn indications for sequestrectomy, amputations.  
3. Identify congenital skeletal anomalies and refer for appropriate correction or rehabilitation.  
4. Recognize metabolic bone diseases relevant to Indian context.  
5. Explain etiopathogenesis, manifestations, and diagnosis of bone neoplasms.  
6. Enumerate few recent advances in Orthopaedics.  

### Skills

At the end of the course, the student shall be able to:

7. Detect sprains and deliver first aid for common fractures and sprains; manage uncomplicated fractures of clavicle, distal radius, forearm, and phalanges.  
8. Use techniques of splinting, plaster, and immobilization for fractures.  
9. Detect and plan treatment algorithm for common deformities of bone and joint.  
10. Advise aspects of rehabilitation for Polio, Cerebral Palsy and Amputation.  
11. Apply compression bandage for injuries over extremities.
