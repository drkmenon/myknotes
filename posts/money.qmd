**Is money the root cause of all problems?** By the way, what is money? Why is there so much taboo surrounding money matters and money itself?

In simple terms, **money is what money does**. It amplifies who you are. If you are a criminal, it will make you a bigger criminal. If you are a saint, it will make you an even greater one. Money is neutral—it is neither good nor bad. Power projected onto others, crimes, and deeds that harm people are more visible and capture public imagination. Because of this, most people trace money as the root cause of such problems.

People generally don’t like to talk about money in public. This is especially true in civilisational countries like India. The reason is partly philosophical and partly paternalistic. Civilisations have long concluded that desire is the root cause of misery. Those who openly talk about money are therefore often looked down upon. Baby boomers everywhere tend to cling to whatever money and assets—and the power that money brings—by all possible means. They spread the idea that talking or thinking about money is not everyone’s business, using different techniques to achieve this, including demeaning money itself.

Yet, beyond all this, the fact remains that money is a very important factor in our lives, and it is essential for many of the things we want and need.
