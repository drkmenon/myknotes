## Pink roses

Artist: Parvathy Menon

Medium: Water-colour

Tender pink roses in a creamy yellow background with dark green leaves create an atmosphere of calmness and serenity. The painting is in watorcolour. Gentle blending and shading brings out the flowers’ three-dimensional quality, making them the focal point, while the subtle lighting effect adds warmth and serenity to the scene.

The overall composition seems to celebrate the simplicity and elegance of nature. The roses, a classic symbol of beauty, are placed in an ordinary, everyday object (the pot), reinforcing the idea that beauty can thrive in simple, unpretentious settings.

`The warm, glowing background adds a timeless, ethereal quality to the image, almost as if it's capturing a moment of peace that could last forever.`
