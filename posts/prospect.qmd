### What will you prefer?

::: panel-tabset
## §1

1.  Get ₹50 definitely

2.  Option to get ₹100 or nothing with the toss of a coin (*p=0.05*).

## \$2

1.  Lose ₹50 definitely

2.  Option to lose ₹100 or nothing with the toss of a coin (*p=0.05*).
:::

If you choose 1 for both §1 and §2, you are a **risk averter**

If you choose 2 for both §1 and §2, you are a **risk taker**

If you don't have any preference, you are **risk neutral**

In general, if we have something to lose, we generally prefer small definite gain over a risky bet. But if we are already in a losing position, we tend to take more risk.
