### Definition:

`Bone is a specialised Connective tissue`[^1].

[^1]: This is the standard answer for all questions about the definition of any living tissue we deal with in Orthopaedics: **it is a specialised connective tissue.**

Bone includes cells and extracellular matrix. Most common type of collagen is seen bone is *Type 1 collagen* [^2]
