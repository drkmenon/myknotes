### Cerclage Wire:

-   **Tensile Strength**: Proportional to wire diameter. The optimal number of twists is 4-8.
-   **Notch Sensitivity**: A 1% notch in the wire can reduce tensile strength by 60%.
-   **Cable**: Has higher fatigue resistance than wire.
-   **Alternatives**: Number 5 Ethibond has 30% tensile strength of an 18g wire, and Mersilene tape has 50% of an 18g wire.

### Screws:

-   **Purpose**: Convert rotational motion into linear motion, creating compressive force.

#### Screw Pullout Factors:

-   **Increases With**:
    -   Larger screw diameter
    -   Longer embedded length
    -   High-quality bone
    -   More surface area and cortical purchase
    -   Increased thread depth and pitch
-   **Cannulated Screws**: Lower pullout strength (15% less than non-cannulated screws), as the core diameter is increased, reducing thread depth and rigidity.

#### Components of a Screw:

-   **Core Diameter**: Diameter of the screw's core.
-   **Outer Diameter**: Total diameter of the screw.
-   **Effective Thread Depth**: The difference between core and outer diameter (larger depth increases pullout strength).
-   **Pitch**: Distance traveled per screw turn (increased pitch lowers pullout strength; decreased pitch increases it).
-   **Head**: Allows driver attachment, halts motion.
-   **Tap**: Creates a female helix for screw threads. Self-tapping screws cut threads automatically.

### Nails:

-   **Strength**: Bending and torsional rigidity increase with the 4th power of radius (doubling the radius increases rigidity by 16 times).
-   **Slotted Nails**: Similar calculations but take into account the inner diameter, making them weaker than solid nails.
-   **Advantage**: Nails act as load-sharing devices but are vulnerable in metaphyseal fractures due to increased stress on the locking screws and bolts.

#### Design Improvements:

-   **Material Around Locking Holes**: Increased to prevent failure.
-   **Screws Locking into Nails**: Enhance stability.
-   **Working Length**: The unsupported length, longer lengths result in less stiffness and greater stress.

### Plates:

-   **Weaknesses**: More prone to failure due to low bending rigidity. They rely on the fracture reduction for stability, functioning as load-sharing devices.
-   **Positioning**: Plates should be placed on the tensile side of the bone to prevent fracture gapping and reduce bending moments.
-   **Pre-bending**: Helps avoid gapping on the far cortex, improving the load distribution.

#### Locking Plates:

-   **Fixed Angle Construct**: Near the mechanical axis, eliminating weak points between screws and the plate.
-   **Benefits**: Avoids periosteal blood supply disruption and enables minimally invasive application.
-   **Challenges**: Excessive stiffness and lack of compression can cause non-union, and cross-threading can reduce stiffness.

### External Fixation:

-   **Working Length**: As in nails and plates, working length is critical for construct stiffness. Placing bars closer to the skin shortens working length, increasing stiffness.
-   **Stiffness Factors**:
    -   Increasing the size of pins or bars.
    -   Shortening the working length from the fracture.
    -   Adding more pins and bars.
    -   Reducing the distance from the bars to the skin.

### Forces and Effects on Orthopedic Implants:

-   **Strength**: Depends on material properties and structure shape. Tubular structures are more vulnerable to torsion.
-   **Stiffness**: A material's ability to resist deformation. Stress divided by strain.
-   **Rigidity**: A structural property that refers to the ability to resist deformation.

#### Plates:

-   **Rigidity**: Increases with the 3rd power of thickness (doubling thickness increases rigidity 8 times).

#### Tubular Structures:

-   **Torsional Rigidity**: Proportional to the 4th power of radius (doubling radius increases torsional rigidity 16 times).
