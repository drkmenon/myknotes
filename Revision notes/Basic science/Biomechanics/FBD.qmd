**Free body diagram**: `A special type of vector diagram used to study the magnitude and direction of forces acting on body`

## Free Body Diagrams

A way of analysing the **static forces** and **moments** acting on a joint, FBD is a 2d simplification of a 3d structure

It is a static analysis (inertia – Newton’s first law) 

All other variables must be equal to zero

**6 variables are present**

• Force in the x, y and z axes

• The moments created in these axes

**Seven assumptions are made when using free body analysis**

**(JOIN BMW)**

1\.     **J**oints are frictionless hinges

2\.     **O**nly compressive forces act on joints

3\.     **I**nternal forces are equal - therefore not analysed (within the body)

4\.     **N**o antagonistic muscle action

5\.     **B**ones are rigid rods

6\.     **M**uscular force is in the direction of the muscle belly

7\.     **W**eight of the body is concentrated at the centre of the body mass

## **Also remember**

-   Body we draw should be in equilibrium

-   There are no antagonistic muscles

-   Muscle act only through tendon

-   JRF is always compressive

## **Hip FBD**

**Abductor moment = body moment in equilibrium**

Fd = w x 5d

F = 5w

\*w is generally taken as 5/6 of the body weight as the person is standing on one leg. Weight of one leg is generally taken a 1/6 body weight.

\*F is the abductor force of contraction.

JRF

## **How to reduce JRF in hip?**

**Carry weight on same side!**

![](images/8.png){width="400"}

**F x d + F' x 2d = w x 5d**

**F + F' = 5w**

**F = 5w - F'**

So the abductor force of contraction required is reduced from F to F-2F'

**Carry stick on the opposite side!**

![](images/9.png){width="450"}

Pressing the stick on to the ground will produce an equal and opposite ground reaction force, s.

**F x d = w x 5d - s x 10d**

**F = 5w - 10s**

So the abductor force of contraction required is reduced from F to F-10s

## **Ankle FBD**

It is important to keep the ankle in dynamic equilibrium

This essentially make ankle a reverse hip joint, another type one lever

![](images/11.png){width="500"}

**F x d = w x 3d**

F = 3 w

## **Spine FBD**

Assume a man bending forward and trying to take a brick. Here the motion segment is again acting as a type 1 lever.

## **JRF Spine**

## **Cervical Spine FBD**

![](images/15.png){width="400"}

**F x d = w x d**

**F = w**

## **Patello femoral joint FBD**

![](images/16.png){width="700"}

The quadriceps and patellar tendon are in equilibria, with a force 4F on either direction. The JRF is less than 4F. JRF is maximum when in flexion and negligible in extension of knee joint.

## **Knee joint FBD**

![](images/17.png)

We can see that when a person is about to raise from a chair, knee joint acts as a second order lever. Weight is acting down from the middle of the thigh and the quadriceps force F is directed towards the knee.

## **Shoulder joint FBD**

![](images/18.png){width="350"}

Here we can see that shoulder is a third order lever.

## **Elbow and fingers FBD**
