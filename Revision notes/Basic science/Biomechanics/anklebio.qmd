#### Functional Goals

-   The foot must be both **flexible** and **rigid**, depending on the phase of gait and activity.
-   Foot and ankle joints transmit significant loads:
    -   **2x body weight** at rest.
    -   **3x body weight** while walking.
    -   **13x body weight** when running.
-   The foot needs to be a **rigid lever** during push-off and heel strike and **supple** during stance, especially on uneven ground.

#### Foot and Ankle Movements

-   **Dorsiflexion/Plantarflexion**: Occur in the sagittal plane at the ankle joint.
-   **Varus/Valgus**: Movement in the coronal plane at the hindfoot.
-   **Abduction/Adduction**: Transverse movement of the midfoot from the midline.
-   **Pronation/Supination**:
    -   **Supination**: Combines ankle plantarflexion, subtalar varus, and midfoot adduction.
-   **Inversion/Eversion**:
    -   **Inversion**: Combines subtalar varus and forefoot supination.
    -   **Eversion**: Combines subtalar valgus and forefoot pronation.

#### Ankle and Talus

-   The **talus** is wider anteriorly and moves within a **10-degree oblique axis** between the malleoli.
-   During **dorsiflexion**, the talus rotates externally, while during **plantarflexion**, it rotates internally.
-   As the foot moves, it transitions from **down and in** to **up and out**.

#### Distal Tibiofibular Joint

-   Well-supported by **interosseous membrane (IOM)** and syndesmotic ligaments, with minimal motion (2mm).
-   Large contact area typically prevents arthrosis, but if stabilizers are disturbed, rapid arthritis can develop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ankle Movements During Gait

-   **Ankle provides**:
    -   20 degrees of dorsiflexion (DF) and 30 degrees of plantarflexion (PF).
    -   11 degrees of tibial rotation (supplemented by subtalar motion for forward propulsion).
-   **Gait cycle**:
    -   At **heel strike**, the ankle is neutral or slightly PF, followed by further PF in early stance.
    -   During **mid-stance**, DF occurs as the body moves over the foot, followed by PF again during **push-off**.
    -   **Swing phase**: Progressive DF occurs to clear the floor, followed by PF in preparation for heel strike.

#### Kinetics of the Ankle

-   **Large contact area** lowers stress compared to the hip or knee, hence less arthritis.
-   Sensitivity to disruptions: A 1mm taller shift can increase contact pressure by 42%, leading to early arthritis.
-   **Gastrosoleus complex** (via Achilles tendon) works to maintain upright stance, causing compressive forces on the ankle joint.
-   Ankle joint reaction force is proportional to gastrosoleus activity, which explains pain during tiptoeing in osteoarthritis (OA) patients.

#### Achilles Anatomy

-   The Achilles tendon spirals as it moves distally, with **medial fibers inserting posteriorly** and **lateral fibers inserting anteriorly**.
-   **Achilles tendon lengthening** cuts should align with the fiber arrangement: **Distal Anterior, Medial Proximal** (DAMP procedure).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Subtalar and Foot Biomechanics

-   **Subtalar joint (STJ)** acts as a torque converter, translating tibial rotation into foot pronation and supination.
-   STJ provides 20 degrees inversion and 5 degrees eversion.
-   **Axis of rotation**: In normal feet, 1 degree of tibial rotation yields 1 degree of inversion/eversion.
-   Variations:
    -   **Flat feet**: More foot rotation due to a more horizontal subtalar axis.
    -   **Cavus feet**: Less rotation due to a more vertical axis.
-   In the absence of subtalar motion (e.g., **tarsal coalition**), inversion/eversion occurs at the ankle joint.

#### Midtarsal/Transverse Tarsal Motion (Chopart's Joint)

-   The **talonavicular (TN)** joint is a ball-and-socket joint, and the **calcaneocuboid (CC)** joint is saddle-shaped.
-   In **pronation**, the joints unlock, making the foot supple.
-   In **supination** (e.g., during push-off), the joints lock, providing a rigid lever arm for efficient push-off.

#### Tarsometatarsal Joint Motion

-   Movement is restricted to less than **5 degrees dorsiflexion** and **15 degrees plantarflexion** by strong ligaments and bony architecture.
-   The joints form the **transverse arch** of the midfoot, centered around the 2nd tarsometatarsal joint (**Lisfranc's joint**).

#### Metatarsal Break

-   Refers to the **oblique axis** at which the metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJs) extend, varying between 50-70 degrees in individuals.

#### Plantar Fascia

-   Originates at the calcaneus and inserts into the tarsal joints and proximal phalanges.
-   Functions as a **truss** that supports the arches and works via the **windlass mechanism**.
-   During **toe-off**, the plantar fascia tightens, locking the tarsal joints and raising the longitudinal arch, making the foot a rigid lever.

### Ankle Replacement Considerations

#### First-Generation Implants (1970s)

-   **Cemented**, constrained, or unconstrained designs, prone to failure due to:
    -   Cementing requiring large bone resection.
    -   **Constrained implants** loosening at the bone-implant interface.
    -   **Unconstrained implants** leading to instability due to soft tissue balancing issues.

#### Second-Generation Implants

-   **Semi-constrained** designs with three components.
    -   Allow sliding in AP, mediolateral directions, and dorsi-plantar flexion.
    -   **Uncemented**, reducing subsidence and loosening.
    -   Improved balance with **thicker polyethylene** inserts (fixed or mobile).
    -   Examples: **LCS and STAR** (mobile poly), **Agility** (fixed poly with tibiofibular fusion).
-   Indications: OA or rheumatoid arthritis in low-demand elderly patients.
-   Contraindications: Infection, lack of bone stock, deformity, high demand, neuropathy, or vascular insufficiency.
-   Complications: Malpositioning leading to impingement, instability, malleolar fracture, or premature wear.

#### Third-Generation Designs

-   Introduce **conical-shaped talar components**, designed to be more anatomical. Long-term results are still pending.
