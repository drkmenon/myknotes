**Humerus**\
- **Neck-Shaft Angle**: 130 degrees, with 30 degrees retroversion from the epicondylar axis.\
- **Head Eccentricity**: 9mm posterior to the central axis of the shaft.

**Glenoid**\
- **Tilt**: 5 degrees superior tilt and 7 degrees retroverted from the plane of the scapula.\
- **Scapula Alignment**: Scapula is anteverted by 30-40 degrees to the coronal plane, making the overall glenoid position 25-35 degrees anteverted, corresponding to humeral retroversion.

**Clavicle**\
- Firmly fixed to the scapula by coracoclavicular ligaments.\
- Circumducts around the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ).\
- Disruption of the acromioclavicular (AC) and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments can lead to scapulothoracic instability.

### Shoulder Motion

-   **Glenohumeral Motion**:
    -   Responsible for the first 30 degrees of abduction (ABD) and 60 degrees of forward flexion (FF).
    -   The rotator cuff stabilizes the humeral head, providing a fulcrum for the deltoid to act upon.
-   **Scapulothoracic Motion**:
    -   As shoulder movement increases, the humeral head translates inferiorly.
    -   The scapula moves to maintain articulation with the glenoid, preventing impingement and maintaining deltoid length.\
    -   **GH vs SC Motion Ratio**: 2:1 during most arm elevation, transitioning to 1:1 at the end range.

### Glenohumeral Stability

Stability is achieved through both static and dynamic stabilizers, creating a concavity compression force.

#### Static Stabilisers

| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Labrum** | Provides 20% of stability, deepens glenoid concavity, attaches biceps and GH ligaments. |
| **Articular Geometry** | Slight mismatch in the radius of glenoid and humeral head helps stability. |
| **GH Ligaments & Capsule** | SGHL, MGHL, and IGHL provide key support in various movements. |
| **Negative Pressure** | Creates suction effect for stability, lost with capsular tears. |
| **Surface Area Mismatch** | The larger humeral head increases joint reaction force, compressing it into the glenoid for stability. |

-   **Labrum**: Triangular cross-section like the meniscus, deepening the glenoid by 9mm supero-inferiorly and 5mm antero-posteriorly.

-   **GH Ligaments**:

    -   **Superior GH Ligament (SGHL)**: Arises from the supraglenoid tubercle and attaches to the lesser tuberosity, preventing internal rotation (IR) of the adducted arm.
    -   **Middle GH Ligament (MGHL)**: Contributes to anterior stability below 90 degrees abduction.
    -   **Inferior GH Ligament (IGHL)**: Primary stabilizer in abduction, forming a "hammock" around the humeral head.

-   **Coracohumeral Ligament**: Limits external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR), stopping humeral head translation.

#### Dynamic Stabilisers

| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Rotator Cuff** | Compresses the humeral head into the glenoid, providing a fulcrum for power muscles. |
| **Biceps Tendon** | Depresses the humeral head, stabilizing against the glenoid. |
| **Scapular Rotators** | Levator scapulae, rhomboids, trapezius, serratus anterior - position the scapula. |
| **Deltoid** | Provides vertical shear force in the adducted position, contributing to concavity compression. |
| **Proprioception** | Vital for stability, especially in multi-directional instability (MDI). |

### Shoulder Replacement

Keys to a successful outcome in shoulder replacement include careful patient selection, restoration of anatomical alignment, and durable fixation.

#### Glenoid Component Fixation

| **Design**           | **Details**                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Flat-backed**      | Prone to loosening in the long term.    |
| **Spherical-backed** | More popular due to less loosening.     |
| **Pegged or Keeled** | Pegged designs are currently preferred. |

#### Types of Shoulder Replacement

| **Option** | **Details** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Hemiarthroplasty** | Suitable for lower-demand patients; avoids glenoid issues, but function and pain outcomes not as good as total shoulder replacement (TSR). |
| **Total Shoulder Replacement (TSR)** | Full replacement of both humeral head and glenoid. |
| **Resurfacing** | Requires adequate bone stock, lower morbidity if successful. |
| **Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA)** | Ideal for patients with cuff deficiency; utilizes the deltoid for abduction. |

### Principles of Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA)

-   RSA optimizes the position of the **deltoid** as an abductor by adjusting the glenoid and humeral component positions:
    -   **Humeral Shaft Lowering**: Increases deltoid tension.
    -   **Glenoid Medialization**: Increases the deltoid lever arm and reduces torque on the metaglene, minimizing the risk of loosening.
    -   **Humeral Component Orientation**: Placed almost horizontally, improving stability throughout the range of motion around the metaglene.
