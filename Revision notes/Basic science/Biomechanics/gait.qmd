**Gait Analysis**

**Overview**\
Gait can be assessed clinically or with greater accuracy in a gait analysis lab. This section discusses the prerequisites, determinants, and abnormalities in gait, offering a comprehensive understanding of both normal and pathological gait patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Pre-requisites for Normal Walking**

There are five key prerequisites to achieve a normal walking gait, summarized by the acronym **SAFE Pre-positioning**:

1.  **Stable stance phase**\
2.  **Adequate step distance**\
3.  **Foot clearance during swing**\
4.  **Energy conservation**\
5.  **Pre-positioning of the foot in swing phase**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Determinants of Gait**

The following factors ensure smooth and efficient movement during walking:

| **Determinants**                | **Description**                           |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Pelvic tilt**                 | Helps smooth the gait cycle.              |
| **Pelvic lateral displacement** | Minimizes vertical oscillation.           |
| **Pelvic rotation**             | Increases stride length.                  |
| **Knee flexion**                | Allows foot clearance and absorbs impact. |
| **Ankle and foot motion**       | Facilitates propulsion and stability.     |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **The Gait Cycle**

The gait cycle begins when the foot strikes the ground and ends when the same foot strikes again, with one cycle equal to one stride.

-   **Stance Phase** (60% of the gait cycle)\
-   **Swing Phase** (40% of the gait cycle)

#### **Mnemonic: I Like My Tea Put In My Teapot**

1.  **Stance Phase**
    1.  Initial contact (heel strike)\
    2.  Loading\
    3.  Mid-stance\
    4.  Terminal stance\
    5.  Pre-swing (toe-off)
2.  **Swing Phase**
    1.  Initial swing\
    2.  Mid-swing\
    3.  Terminal swing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Clinical Assessment of Gait Phases**

In practice, clinicians focus on four primary phases:

1.  **Weight acceptance**
    -   Initial contact and loading
2.  **Stance**
    -   Mid-stance and terminal stance
3.  **Forward progression**
    -   Terminal stance and pre-swing
4.  **Swing**
    -   Includes all swing phases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Important Gait Definitions**

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Step** | Distance from one foot contact to the opposite foot contact. |
| **Stride** | Distance from one foot contact to the same foot making contact again. |
| **Cadence** | Number of steps taken per unit time. |
| **Double support phase** | When both feet are in contact with the ground. |
| **Float phase** | When neither foot is in contact with the ground (occurs in running). |
| **Velocity** | Stride length divided by stride time (meters/second). |
| **Walking base** | Distance between the heels when standing still. |
| **Foot progression angle** | Angle of foot direction in relation to the midline, described as positive or negative. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Age-related Gait Changes**

-   **18 months** – Broad-based stiff knee gait\
-   **7 years** – Achieves adult gait\
-   **After 70 years**:
    1.  **Velocity decreases**\
    2.  **Step length decreases**\
    3.  **Double support phase increases**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **BMI-related Gait Changes**

-   Step and stride length decreases.\
-   Stance phase duration increases.\
-   If thighs touch during walking, leg circumduction occurs to overcome friction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Clinical Gait Analysis**

A clinical gait analysis involves inspecting the pelvis, knees, ankles, and feet during the gait cycle. Below is a summary of the normal movements seen during gait:

| **Joint** | **Movement** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Pelvis** | Rotates anteriorly at heel strike, posteriorly at toe-off, and tilts during swing. |
| **Hip** | Flexion aids clearance; extension prevents collapse. |
| **Knee** | Hamstrings cushion heel strike and aid swing; quads stabilize during loading. |
| **Ankle** | Follows a three-rocker motion: controlled plantarflexion, dorsiflexion control, and push-off. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3D Gait Analysis**

Advanced 3D gait analysis is particularly useful for analyzing complex gait patterns, such as those seen in cerebral palsy. This type of analysis examines:

-   **Kinematics** – Motion patterns\
-   **Kinetics** – Forces required for motion\
-   **Plantar pressure profiles** – Weight-bearing patterns on the foot\
-   **EMG** – Muscle firing patterns\
-   **Efficiency** – Oxygen and energy consumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Abnormalities of Gait**

**Trendelenberg Gait**\
- Trunk bends laterally toward the standing leg due to weak or painful hips.

**Anterior Trunk Bending**\
- Seen when patients bend forward to compensate for knee extension issues or quad weakness.

**Posterior Trunk Bending**\
- Occurs due to weak hip extensors, resulting in compensatory trunk movements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Pathological Gait Patterns**

| **Pathologic Gait** | **Description** |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Steppage Gait** | Caused by equinus deformity. |
| **Hip Scissoring Gait** | Due to spastic adductors. |
| **Antalgic Gait** | Shortened stance time on a painful limb. |
| **Quadriceps Avoidance Gait** | Seen in ACL-deficient knees. |
| **Shuffling Gait** | Due to weakness or fear of falling, often associated with Parkinson’s disease. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Muscle Activity During Gait**

Muscle groups play specific roles throughout the gait cycle:

-   **Dorsiflexors** are **concentric** throughout the swing phase and **eccentric** at initial contact and loading.
-   **Plantarflexors** are **inactive** during the swing phase, but **eccentric** in mid-stance and **concentric** during pre-swing (toe-off).
