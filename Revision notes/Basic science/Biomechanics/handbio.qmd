### Biomechanics of the Hand

#### Interphalangeal (IP) Joints

-   **Single axis hinge joints** allowing flexion/extension.
-   **Center of rotation (COR)** is slightly anterior to the collateral ligament origin.
-   **Static stability** is provided by:
    -   Bony architecture (similar to the knee joint)
    -   Collateral ligaments
    -   Volar plate

#### Metacarpophalangeal (MP) Joints

-   These joints have **two axes of movement**: flexion/extension and abduction/adduction.
-   **Abduction/adduction** only occurs when the proximal phalanx (P1) is flexed to 30 degrees.
-   This leads to **circumduction** around the metacarpal head.
-   Static stability components are the same as in IP joints (bony structure, collateral ligaments, volar plate).

#### Carpometacarpal (CMC) Joints of the Fingers

-   **Ulnarward movement** restricts mobility progressively, with the 4th and 5th CMC joints being highly rigid, transmitting forces from hand to wrist.
-   The **third metacarpal (MC)** acts as a cantilever to support flexor sheaths, and the fibrous framework includes collateral ligaments and transverse metacarpal ligaments.

#### Thumb CMC Joint

-   A **saddle joint** with **two axes of movement** similar to the MP joints of the fingers.
-   **Circumduction** is a consequence of the two axes of movement when the thumb metacarpal is slightly flexed.
-   **Trapezium** and **metacarpal base** have differing radii of curvature, allowing thumb pronation and increased range of motion, though at the expense of stability.
-   Stability comes from the **volar oblique (beak) ligament** and the capsule, but this ligament is prone to rupture, leading to **joint instability**. It can be repaired or reconstructed with a trapeziectomy if needed.
-   **Loading of the thumb CMCJ** can reach up to 120 kg, with most force transmitted through the volar half, making the **volar oblique ligament** particularly vulnerable to attenuation or rupture.
-   The **thumb CMCJ and MPJ** work in unison, as motor tendons cross both joints.

### Motor Systems and Tendon Excursion

-   The hand's movement is powered by **flexors, extensors, and intrinsic muscles**.
-   **Tendon excursion** lengths:
    -   Flexor and extensor tendons: 30-50-70 mm.
    -   Wrist flexors and extensors: 30 mm.

#### Extensor Mechanism

-   Composed of **long extensors (extrinsics)** and **intrinsic muscles**.
-   The **extensor hood** is made up of:
    -   Long extensor tendons
    -   Lumbricals (on the radial side)
    -   Interossei
-   **Lateral bands** control the distal phalanx, and the **central slip** controls the middle phalanx.

#### Flexor Mechanism

-   **Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP)** is a mass-action muscle with some independent action in the index finger.
-   The **quadrigia effect** occurs when shortening or tethering of one FDP tendon causes slight flexion in the other DIP joints.
-   Tension in the FDP is constant during contraction, with **greater torque proximally** because the moment arm between the MPJ COR and DIPJ COR is longer at the MPJ. Thus, higher torque is generated at the MPJ even for small loads.
-   **Annular pulleys (A1-4)** prevent bowstringing and maintain tendon proximity to the COR of each joint, maximizing power. A2 and A4 are the most important.
-   **Cruciate pulleys (C1-3)** lie between annular pulleys, supporting tendon sheaths.
-   The **flexor retinaculum** also acts as a pulley.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Intrinsic Muscles

#### Lumbricals

-   **Unique muscles**: they originate from the FDP tendons and insert into the extensor hood.
-   Lumbricals fine-tune the tension between the **flexor** and **extensor systems**.

#### Interossei

-   **Palmar interossei** adduct the fingers, while **dorsal interossei** abduct them.
-   Both types arise from the **metacarpal shafts** and contribute to the **extensor hood**.

#### Combined Function of Intrinsics

-   Together, the **intrinsics** flex the MPJ and extend the PIPJ, with the **lumbricals** playing a larger role due to their distance from the MPJ COR, which gives them a longer moment arm.
-   Intrinsics allow the fingers to flex without curling, which is essential for grasping large objects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Clinical Conditions of Intrinsic Muscle Imbalance

-   **Intrinsic paralysis** leads to the **intrinsic-minus hand**, characterized by hyperextension of the MPJ due to the long extensors and a flexed posture of the DIPJ and PIPJ due to long flexor tension, creating a claw-hand deformity.

    -   **Grasping** is impossible in this condition, and fingers curl into a fist from the distal (FDP) to proximal (FDS) tendons.

-   **Intrinsic-plus hand** is the opposite, due to **intrinsic tightness**. The MPJs are flexed, and the PIPJs extended.

-   **Lumbrical paradox**: Because the lumbricals bridge between the long flexors and extensors, paradoxical PIPJ extension can occur when attempting to flex the fingers.

-   **Lumbrical-plus finger**: An extreme example of this paradox, where FDS is sectioned distal to the lumbrical origin. All FDS power is transmitted via the lumbrical to the long extensors, causing **PIPJ hyperextension** when the FDS contracts.
