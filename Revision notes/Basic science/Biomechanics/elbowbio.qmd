### Elbow Anatomy and Biomechanics

-   **Trochlea-Capitellar Axis**: The axis is 6 degrees off a line perpendicular to the humerus, resulting in a valgus carrying angle of the forearm:
    -   **Men**: Mean carrying angle of 7 degrees.
    -   **Women**: Mean carrying angle of 13 degrees.
    -   The carrying angle disappears with elbow flexion.
-   **Joint Characteristics**:
    -   **Radiohumeral Joint**: Poorly congruent.
    -   **Ulnohumeral Joint**: Highly congruent.
    -   **Capitellum and Radial Head**: The capitellum has a smaller radius than the radial head, allowing rotation in any position of flexion.
    -   **Annular Ligament**: Stabilizes the radial head to the radial notch on the ulna.

### Range of Motion (ROM)

| **Movement** | **Normal ROM** | **Functional ROM** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Flexion      | 0-140°         | 30-130° (100° arc) |
| Supination   | 85°            | 50°                |
| Pronation    | 75°            | 50°                |

-   **Supination** is more critical as shoulder movement compensates poorly for supination loss.
-   **Pronation** is especially important in the writing hand.

### Elbow Kinetics

-   **Forces About the Elbow**: Short lever arms result in inefficient force transmission, leading to high ulnohumeral joint reaction forces, which predisposes the joint to arthritis.

-   **Elbow Free Body Diagram**:

    -   Extension moment equals flexion moment.
    -   The joint reaction force (JRF) can be calculated by considering these forces.

#### Forces Acting on the Elbow

| **Forces in Extension** | **Forces in Flexion** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Load in hand            | Pull of elbow flexors |
| Weight of the forearm   |                       |
| Joint reaction force    |                       |

### Lever Arms (in metres)

| **Lever for Extension** | **Lever for Flexion** |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Distance from elbow COR to hand carrying load | Distance from elbow COR to biceps insertion |
| Distance from elbow COR to midpoint of forearm |  |

#### Example Calculation

For a 25 N weight in a forearm weighing 10 N and measuring 30 cm in length, with a biceps insertion 5 cm from the elbow COR:

\- **Biceps Pull** = (25 x 0.3) + (10 x 0.15) = (0.05 x Biceps pull) → **Biceps Force = 180 N**. - **JRF Calculation**: JRF + 25 + 10 = 180 → JRF = 145 N.

### Elbow Instability

#### Static Stability

-   **Primary Static Stabilizer**: The anterior band of the medial collateral ligament (MCL), which primarily resists valgus forces and distraction.
-   **Secondary Stabilizer**: Radial head, which becomes the primary stabilizer if the MCL is damaged.
-   **Ulnohumeral Articulation**: Highly congruent, providing stability in full extension.
-   **Coronoid Process**: Prevents posterior translation of the ulna. Loss of more than 50% can cause posterior instability, but an intact radial head may compensate.
    -   The **anteromedial part** is especially important as the MCL anterior band attaches here via the **sublime tubercle**.

| **Medial Collateral Ligament** | **Function** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Anterior band | Most important, tight in extension, slack in flexion. |
| Posterior band | Tight in flexion, slack in extension. |
| Transverse ligament (Cooper’s ligament) | Role in stability is less significant. |

-   **Lateral Collateral Ligament**:
    -   Consists of the **lateral radial collateral ligament**, **lateral ulnar collateral ligament**, **accessory lateral collateral ligament**, and the **annular ligament**.
    -   The **ulnar collateral ligament** is the most important for varus and posterolateral rotatory stability, and is usually the first ligament torn in a dislocation.
-   **Anterior Capsule**: Resists hyperextension and posterior translation.

#### Dynamic Stability

-   Provided by muscles crossing the joint, which offer limited stability themselves.

### Elbow Replacement

Elbow replacements can be classified as **linked** or **unlinked**: - **Unlinked**: - Rely on intact collateral ligaments and articular congruency for stability. - Technically challenging to balance and thus falling out of favor.

-   **Linked**:
    -   Not a fixed hinge, but a "sloppy hinge" with 6 degrees of freedom.
    -   Allows for 7-10 degrees of varus-valgus laxity, reducing stress on the bone-implant interface and preventing premature loosening or fracture.
