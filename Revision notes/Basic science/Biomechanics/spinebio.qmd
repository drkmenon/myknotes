#### Spinal Stability (White & Panjabi)

-   **Definition**: The ability of the spine to resist displacement under normal physiological loading, thus protecting neural structures from injury while preventing deformity and pain.

#### Motion Segment

-   A **spinal motion segment** includes two vertebrae and the soft tissues between them.
-   Stability arises from the interaction of three subsystems:
    1.  **Passive musculoskeletal system**: Vertebrae, discs, facet joints, ligaments, and joint capsules.
    2.  **Active musculoskeletal system**: The spinal muscles.
    3.  **Neural system**: Proprioception and neural feedback mechanisms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Passive Musculoskeletal System

#### Vertebrae

-   **7 cervical (C), 12 thoracic (T), 5 lumbar (L), 5 sacral (S), 4 coccygeal** vertebrae.
-   Vertebrae become wider and deeper as they move **caudally**, in response to increased loading.
-   **Trabeculae** (vertical and horizontal) form the internal structure of vertebrae under load. Loss of trabeculae (as in **osteoporosis**) predisposes vertebrae to compression fractures.
-   The **S-shaped spine** in the sagittal plane shifts body weight away from the central axis of rotation, aiding balance and gait.
-   The axis of rotation passes through the posterior portion of the vertebral body, and **spinous processes** provide long lever arms for posterior muscles, resisting flexion.

#### Facet Joints

-   Formed between the **inferior articular facet** of one vertebra and the **superior articular facet** of the vertebra below it.
-   Facet joints guide the type of movement possible between vertebrae.
-   They become progressively **more vertical** in the sagittal and coronal planes moving caudally.
    -   Cervical spine: Resistant to translation, more susceptible to flexion/extension.
    -   Lumbar spine: More resistant to flexion/extension.
    -   Thoracic spine: Extra stability from the rib cage.

#### Spinal Ligaments

-   **Ligamentum flavum**: High elastin content, preventing buckling inward. Degeneration can cause it to buckle and contribute to **spinal stenosis**.
-   **Posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL)** and **anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL)**: Resist flexion and extension forces.
-   Other ligaments include **intertransverse** and **interspinous ligaments**.

#### Intervertebral Discs

-   **Shock absorbers** between vertebrae that distribute load and allow limited movement. Their properties are discussed in other chapters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Active Musculoskeletal System

-   Consists of **spinal muscles**, which include:
    -   **Extensor muscles**: Arranged in three layers (deep, intermediate, and superficial).
    -   **Abdominal muscles**: Help stabilize the spine, especially the lumbar region.
    -   **Intercostals** and **lower trunk muscles**: Play roles in stability and respiration.
-   **Extensor muscles**:
    1.  **Deep muscles**: Interspinalis, intertransversalis.
    2.  **Intermediate muscles**: Multifidus, semispinalis (lie between the deep layer and transverse processes).
    3.  **Superficial muscles**: Erector spinae (longissimus, spinalis, iliocostalis, splenius).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Neural Subsystem

-   Proprioception is critical in the spine due to its constantly changing positions and loading. It helps coordinate movement and maintain balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Interaction of Subsystems in Spinal Stability

-   **Spinal range of motion** is divided into two zones:
    1.  **Neutral zone**: The initial, highly flexible range where the **active and neural systems** dominate, providing proprioceptive feedback to control movement.
    2.  **Elastic zone**: Occurs toward the end of the motion range, where the **passive system** limits movement and provides stability, preventing damage to neural structures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spinal Disease or Injury

-   Conditions like **degenerative disc disease** or **burst fractures** increase the size of the neutral zone beyond the normal physiological range, leading to instability.
-   The widened neutral zone increases the risk of neurological injury due to excess movement.
-   In a **diseased spine**, enhancing the **active musculoskeletal system** (i.e., muscle strengthening) can help minimize the increase in the neutral zone, restoring some stability.
