## Stress

-   **Definition**: Force applied per unit area.
-   **Formula**: σ=F/A (Force/Area)
-   **Unit**: N/m² or Pascals (Pa)\
    Example: 1 Pascal is equivalent to the force of an apple on a 1m² coffee table.

## Strain

-   **Definition**: The measure of deformation, representing the change in length relative to the original length.
-   **Formula**: Strain=ΔL/L~0~​
-   **Unit**: Unit less\
    It is expressed as a ratio or percentage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Material Properties

A material's properties depend on the forces applied to it:

### Isotropic Materials

-   **Definition**: Mechanical properties remain the same regardless of the type of force applied.
-   **Examples**: Woven bone, polymers, and many metals.

### Anisotropic Materials

-   **Definition**: Mechanical properties vary with the type of force applied.
-   **Examples**: Most living tissues, such as cortical bone, tendons, and ligaments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stress-Strain Curve

-   **Purpose**: Used to analyze material properties.

-   **Young’s Modulus**: The gradient of the stress-strain curve. It measures the stiffness of a material.

    -   **High Young's Modulus**: Stiffer material.
    -   **Formula**: ( E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} ) (Stress/Strain)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Young’s Modulus of Various Orthopaedic Materials:

| Material                 | Young's Modulus (GPa) |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Ceramic**              | 250                   |
| **Cobalt Chrome (CoCr)** | 225                   |
| **Stainless Steel**      | 200                   |
| **Titanium**             | 100                   |
| **Cortical Bone**        | 20                    |
| **PMMA**                 | 2                     |
| **Polyethylene**         | 1.5                   |
| **Cancellous Bone**      | 1                     |
| **Tendon**               | 0.1                   |
| **Cartilage**            | 0.02                  |

### Regions of the Stress-Strain Curve

#### 1. **Elastic Region**

-   **Behavior**: Stress and strain are proportional.
-   **Law**: Follows Hooke's Law.
-   **Key Property**: If stress is removed, the material returns to its original shape.

#### 2. **Toe Region** (Tendons/Ligaments only)

-   **Behavior**: Non-linear increase in stress and strain due to the uncrimping of fibers.

#### 3. **Plastic Region**

-   **Proportional Limit**: Stress is no longer proportional to strain, but deformation is still recoverable.
-   **Elastic Limit**: The end of recoverable deformation.
-   **Yield Point**: The material begins to deform plastically and will not return to its original shape after stress is removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Material Toughness and Ductility

-   **Toughness**: The area under the entire stress-strain curve. It represents the total energy absorbed before the material fractures.

-   **Ductile Materials**: Exhibit a large plastic region before fracturing (e.g., metals).

-   **Brittle Materials**: Show almost no plastic behavior; the yield point is very close to the fracture point (e.g., ceramics).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)

-   **Definition**: The maximum stress a material can withstand before breaking.
-   **Application**: Stainless steel plates have a high UTS and are more suitable for non-union fractures compared to titanium plates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other Key Material Properties

### Fatigue Failure

-   **Definition**: Failure due to repetitive stress below the ultimate tensile strength.
-   **S-N Curve**: Represents the relationship between stress and the number of cycles to failure.

| Component             | Endurance Limit             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Hip Replacements**  | Above endurance limit       |
| **Knee Replacements** | Below or at endurance limit |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Additional Properties

-   **Stiffness vs. Rigidity**: Stiffness is a material property, while rigidity refers to a structure's ability to resist deformation.

-   **Notch Sensitivity**: A material's resistance to fracture when notched or irregular.

    -   **Low Notch Sensitivity**: Ceramics.
    -   **High Notch Sensitivity**: Ductile materials like steel and polyethylene.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visco-Elastic Behavior

Many living tissues exhibit **visco-elastic** behavior, meaning they have both elastic and viscous properties. This behavior is time-dependent:

### Types of Visco-Elastic Behavior

1.  **Creep**: Time-dependent deformation under a constant load (e.g., Ponsetti treatment).
2.  **Stress Relaxation**: Time-dependent reduction in the stress required to maintain deformation (e.g., ACL graft cycling).
3.  **Hysteresis**: The difference in the stress-strain curve during loading and unloading due to energy loss (heat).
