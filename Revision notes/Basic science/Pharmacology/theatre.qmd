## Theatre Layout and Design

### Close Proximity to Related Facilities

-   ICU, A&E, Surgical Wards, Radiology, Pathology

### Zones

-   **Outer Zone**: Reception
-   **Clean Zone**: Reception up to the theatre itself
-   **Aseptic Zone**: Theatres
-   **Disposal Zone**: Dirty corridor for disposal

**Note**: Zones should be linked via corridors that prevent cross-contamination.

## Within Theatre

### Control of Key Factors

1.  **Temperature and Humidity**:
    -   Controlled via ventilation and thermostats.
    -   Patients under anaesthesia are at risk of hypothermia.
    -   **Optimal theatre temperature**: 25°C to prevent hypothermia; 19°C for surgical temperature.
    -   **Solutions**: Bair Hugger, warmed fluids, blankets, airflow mattress.
    -   Higher temperature needed for paediatric patients due to larger body surface area.
    -   **Optimal Humidity**: Around 50%.
2.  **Light**:
    -   Illumination at the wound site should be **40,000 lux**.
    -   Satellite lights: Positioned directly, although they generate heat and convection currents.

## Bacterial Contamination in Theatre

### Sources of Infection

1.  Patient
2.  Instruments
3.  Surgeon
4.  Airborne (95% of infections)

### Airborne Contamination

-   Primarily due to people in the theatre (talking, shedding microorganisms, skin, and clothing).
-   90% of airborne bacteria come from below neck level, especially from axillae and groins.

### Measuring Bacterial Contamination of the Air

-   Measured in **Colony Forming Units (CFU)** or **Bacteria Carrying Particles (BCP)** per cubic meter.
-   **Microbiological Volumetric Slit Sampler**: Draws air over a culture plate, incubated for 48 hours, then counts colonies formed.

### Frequency of Measurement

-   **Plenum theatres**: Every time they are refurbished.
-   **Extra clean theatres**: Every 3 months.

### Acceptable CFU/m3 values

-   **Plenum**: \<35 CFU & \<1 CFU of Clostridium Perfringens and Staphylococcus Aureus.
-   **Ultra-Clean**: \<20 CFU in the periphery and \<10 CFU in the centre.

## Ventilation

### Key Points

-   The ideal air system should:
    -   Provide a bacteria-free source of air.
    -   Use positive pressure to displace contaminated air from the operative field.

### How Air Enters the Theatre

-   Air enters via roof-level HEPA filters (removing particles of 0.5 microns with 99.9% efficiency).
-   Filters must be monitored regularly.

## Ventilation Systems

| Type of Flow | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Plenum** | Positive pressure maintained by air entering via ceiling/wall diffusers and exiting via floor vents. Air changed 20x per hour. | Reduces ingress of contaminated air | Turbulence due to personnel movement, door openings. Each door opening introduces 2m3 of contaminated air. |
| **Laminar Flow** | Uniform velocity, unidirectional air flow, usually vertical. | Shown to reduce infection in some surgeries | Equipment and personnel can deflect contaminated air towards the wound. |

### Types of Laminar Flow

-   **Horizontal Laminar Flow**:
    -   HEPA filters on walls; airflow across the entire theatre.
    -   Reduces infection in total hip replacement but increases infection in total knee replacement.
-   **Vertical Laminar Flow**:
    -   Introduced by Charnley.
    -   Room within a room concept, air enters through HEPA filters and moves downwards.
    -   Most commonly used type.
    -   Problems occur if personnel or equipment deflect airflow.
-   **Exponential Flow (Ex Flow) System**:
    -   Overcomes vertical flow problems.
    -   Air flows down and out in a trumpet shape.
    -   Requires fewer air changes per hour.

### Clinical Effects of Laminar Flow

-   **MRC 1982 RCT**: Found vertical laminar flow to be more effective in reducing wound contamination.
-   **Charnley**: Demonstrated a reduction in deep infections with laminar flow.

### MRC Trial Findings on Reducing Deep Joint Sepsis

| Method               | Effectiveness      |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Antibiotic Cement    | 11-fold reduction  |
| Systemic Antibiotics | 5-fold reduction   |
| Ultra-clean air      | 2.5-fold reduction |
| Body Suits           | 2-fold reduction   |

## Clothing

### Ideal Clothing Characteristics

-   Prevent shedding of airborne bacteria.
-   Effective when wet.
-   Allows air and water vapor circulation.

| Material | Pore Size | Features | Disadvantages |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Standard Cotton** | 80 microns | Comfortable | Poor bacterial migration prevention, strike-through problem. |
| **Ventile** | 50 microns | Reduced pore size | Uncomfortable, not breathable. |
| **Gore Tex** | 0.2 microns | Breathable | Heavy, expensive. |
| **Disposable Non-Woven** | Variable | Traps bacteria, prevents migration | Single-use, expensive. |

### Body Exhaust Suits

-   Maintain negative pressure within the gown, preventing bacteria escape.

### Surgical Drapes

-   **Disposable Non-Woven Drapes**: Commonly used to prevent bacterial migration.
-   **Incision Drapes**: No independent benefit shown, primarily used to keep body drapes attached to the skin.

### Masks

-   Recommended for all personnel in orthopaedic procedures.
-   Prevent upper respiratory tract bacterial contamination (5% of airborne bacteria).
-   Evidence shows only those near the wound need masks.

### Gloves

-   Protect both the wound and surgeon.
-   **Glove Changing**:
    -   Before making an incision (due to contamination during prepping and draping).
    -   Before handling implants (due to glove colonization during a procedure).
-   **Double Gloving**: 40% incidence of glove perforation in orthopaedic procedures, so double gloving is advised.
