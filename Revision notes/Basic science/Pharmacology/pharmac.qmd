#### Analgesics

1.  **Opioids**

    -   Mimic endogenous opioids by acting at opioid receptors in the CNS.
    -   Act on mu receptors.
    -   Work via G proteins to open potassium and calcium channels.
    -   **Diamorphine**: More lipid-soluble than morphine, therefore faster acting.

2.  **NSAIDs**

    -   Inhibit prostaglandin production by acting on Cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX).
    -   **COX 1** exists in normal tissues.
    -   **COX 2** is present only at sites of inflammation.
    -   **Unselective COX inhibition**: Results in inhibition of prostaglandin production where needed, such as in gastric mucosa.

3.  **Paracetamol**

    -   Weakly inhibits COX and prostaglandin formation.
    -   Also has a central action.

4.  **Local Anaesthetics**

    -   Work by blocking sodium channels in neurons, preventing the formation of an action potential.
    -   Very **pH-dependent**:
        -   Increased action in alkaline environment.
        -   Decreased action in acidic environment.
    -   Block conduction in small myelinated fibers first, then unmyelinated, and large myelinated axons.
    -   **A and C fibers** are blocked first.

5.  **Glucocorticoids**

    -   Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.
    -   Act on all parts of the inflammatory cascade.
    -   Modify gene transcription, altering protein synthesis (e.g., inhibit transcription of the gene that codes for COX 2 synthesis).
    -   Directly suppress macrophage function.
    -   Impair lymphocyte transport.

    **Side Effects**:

    -   **I WAS HOPPING MAD**:
        -   Infection, Wasting and proximal myopathy, Adrenal insufficiency, Sugar disturbance, Hypotension, Osteoporosis, Peptic ulceration, Pancreatitis, Necrosis, Glaucoma, Madness (psychiatric disturbances).

#### Anticoagulants

**Clotting Cascade**

1.  **Intrinsic Pathway**
    -   Activated by exposure of collagen from damaged blood vessels to Factor 12.
    -   Measured using APTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time).
2.  **Extrinsic Pathway**
    -   Activated by the release of thromboplastin by cell damage.
    -   Measured by Prothrombin Time (PT).
3.  **Common Pathway**
    -   Both pathways coalesce at the **common pathway** where **Factor 10** is involved.
    -   **Factor 10** becomes **Factor 10a**, converting **Prothrombin (Factor 2)** to **Thrombin**.
    -   Thrombin converts **Fibrinogen (Factor 1)** to **Fibrin**, forming a lattice to entrap platelets and produce a clot.

**Drugs Affecting Clotting**

1.  **Warfarin**

    -   Similar in structure to vitamin K, which it antagonizes.
    -   Inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by preventing carboxylation of glutamine residues.
    -   Prevents factors from binding calcium, rendering them useless in the clotting cascade.
    -   Factors affected: 2, 7, 9, 10, and Proteins C and S.
    -   Long half-life (40 hours).
    -   Takes 24-48 hours to work, as new clotting factors must replace old ones.
    -   Metabolized in the liver, so liver disease is a contraindication.
    -   Reversed by giving vitamin K, which forms more normal clotting factors.

2.  **Heparin**

    -   Naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan.
    -   Short acting, with a half-life of 4-6 hours.
    -   Requires close monitoring with APTT.
    -   Forms a complex with **Antithrombin 3**, which inactivates thrombin, preventing fibrinogen conversion to fibrin.
    -   Also affects Factor 10a.
    -   Reversed with **Protamine**.

3.  **LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin)**

    -   Forms a complex with Antithrombin 3, selectively inhibiting Factor 10a only.
    -   Longer half-life; requires only once-daily dosing.

    **Side Effects**:

    -   Bleeding (more common with pure heparin).
    -   Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
    -   Osteoporosis with long-term use.

4.  **Fondaparinaux**

    -   Synthetic pentasaccharide.
    -   Selectively inhibits Factor 10a.
    -   Shown to work better than LMWH in some trials.

5.  **Rivaroxiban**

    -   Direct action on Factor 10a.
    -   No effect on platelets or thrombin directly.
    -   Good oral bioavailability but expensive.

6.  **Dabigatran**

    -   Direct thrombin inhibitor.
    -   No reversibility in the event of major bleeding.
    -   Good oral bioavailability.

7.  **Aspirin**

    -   Binds with COX 1, inhibiting prostaglandin production.
    -   Prevents platelet aggregation by inhibiting thromboxane A2 (a prothrombotic agent secreted by platelets).
    -   Acts as an anticoagulant.

#### Drugs Acting on Bone Metabolism

1.  **Bone Remodeling Process**
    -   **Cytokines (IL6)** recruit osteoclasts.
    -   Osteoclasts secrete hydrogen ions and proteolytic enzymes that dig pits in trabecular bone.
    -   Bone factors such as **Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)** recruit osteoblasts to these pits.
    -   Osteoblasts, primed by **PTH** and **1,25 Vit D**, secrete osteoid into the pits along with IGF-1 and release IL-6.
    -   Osteoid is mineralized by **calcium hydroxyapatite**.
    -   **IL6** released by osteoblasts recruits osteoclasts, restarting the cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Drugs Affecting Bone Metabolism**

1.  **Bisphosphonates**
    -   Comprised of a PCP backbone, resistant to phosphatases.
    -   No enzyme can metabolize bisphosphonates, so they remain in the bone until completely resorbed.
    -   **Types**:
        -   **Nitrogen-containing**: Act by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway (e.g., Etidronate, Clodronate).
        -   **Non-nitrogen-containing**: Create a toxic ATP analogue (e.g., Zoledronate, Alendronate, Pamidronate).
    -   **Modes of Action**:
        -   Inhibit osteoclasts directly, preventing ruffled border formation and causing apoptosis.
        -   Stabilize hydroxyapatite crystals.
    -   Useful for bone pain due to increased turnover (e.g., Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta).
2.  **Strontium**
    -   Similar in composition to calcium but not subject to bone metabolism.
    -   Has both anabolic (increases bone formation) and catabolic (decreases bone resorption) effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Anti-Rheumatoid Drugs

1.  **Non-Disease Modifying**
    -   **Steroids**.
    -   **Cyclophosphamide**.
2.  **Disease Modifying (DMARDs)**
    -   **Methotrexate**, **Azathioprine** (Purine metabolism inhibitors).
    -   **TNF Inhibitors**:
        -   **Etanercept**, **Infliximab** (All drugs ending in ‘mab’ are TNF inhibitors).
    -   **Penicillamine**: Reduces T lymphocytes.
