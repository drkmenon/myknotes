### Definition

An orthosis is a device that applies externally to a body segment and improves function by supporting, correcting, or compensating for deformity or weakness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ideal Characteristics of an Orthotic

-   Ease of use
-   Light weight
-   Cosmetic appeal
-   Cost-effective
-   Durable
-   Washable
-   Comfortable
-   Free of pressure areas

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Functional Characteristics of Orthotics

1.  **3 Point Pressure**: Provides a force that can correct or support a deformity.
2.  **End Point Control**: Limits motion at the end range of a joint.
3.  **Total Contact**: Ensures full contact with the body to distribute forces evenly.
4.  **Kinaesthetic Reminder**: Serves as a reminder to the patient about the position and movement of their body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Examples of Orthotics

-   **Provide Support**:
    -   TLSO for an osteoporotic spine.
-   **Limit Motion**:
    -   KO (Knee Orthosis) to prevent knee hyperextension.
-   **Correct Deformity**:
    -   Ponseti boots and bars for clubfoot correction.
-   **Combination**:
    -   KAFO (Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis) in polio rehabilitation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Biomechanics of Orthoses

Orthoses influence moments and forces around a joint in four ways:

1.  **Control of Bending Moments**:
    -   The most common reason for prescription.
    -   Limits motion in a certain plane using 3-point pressure.
    -   Allows movement in other planes (e.g., KO for MCL injury).
2.  **Control of Translation**:
    -   Limits shear force causing translation (e.g., KO in PCL rupture prevents transverse plane translation).
    -   Requires 4-point contact.
3.  **Control of Axial Force**:
    -   Works by sharing the load with the joint, beneficial for painful joints.
4.  **Control of Line of Ground Reaction Force (GRF)**:
    -   Alters the line of GRF, influencing the force across the joint indirectly.
    -   Example: A lateral heel wedge moves load laterally and offloads the painful medial compartment.

### Materials Used in Orthotics

-   **Traditional Materials**: Metals, leather, and rubber.

-   **Common Materials**: Plastics, categorized as follows:

    **Thermosetting Plastics**:

    -   Rigid after heating; do not return to their original shape.
    -   Commonly used in prosthetics for increased rigidity.

    **Thermoforming Plastics**:

    -   Can be reshaped upon reheating.
    -   Vary in the temperature needed for reshaping.
    -   High-temperature thermoplastics are used for AFOs; low-temperature types can be molded directly onto the patient with a hair dryer.

    **Polyurethane Foam**:

    -   Poured into a mold and allowed to harden.
    -   Can be molded directly onto patients.
    -   Examples include neoprene braces, cushions, and corsets.

### Commonly Used Orthoses

#### Foot Orthoses

-   **Insoles**:
    -   **Simple**: Off-the-shelf with little biomechanical value.
    -   **Total Contact**: Thermoplastic molds to match the patient; most common type.
    -   **Functional**: Corrects deformity; the foot is held in a corrected position during molding (e.g., UCBL for flexible deformities).
    -   Types:
        -   **Rigid**: Limits movement and corrects deformity.
        -   **Semi-rigid**: Limits movement in a certain plane (e.g., ankle brace).
        -   **Soft**: Provides a shock-absorbing role to ease pressure areas.

#### Shoe Alterations

-   Can be made internally or externally to the sole and/or heel.
-   **UCBL Insert**: Corrects valgus hindfoot and pronation; useful for tibialis posterior insufficiency.
-   **Heel Raises**: Corrects leg length discrepancy or equinus contracture.
-   **Rocker Bottom**: Convex structure that moves the roll-over point from MT head to MT shaft; offloads distally, helpful for ulcer healing.
-   **Metatarsal Bar**: Flat bar posterior to MT head that offloads MT heads.
-   **Heel Wedges**: Promote supination or pronation by correcting hindfoot alignment (e.g., medial wedge corrects valgus and pronation).
-   **Arch Supports**: Support medial arch and promote supination and heel varus.

#### Custom-Made Shoes

-   **Accommodative**: For fixed deformities (e.g., Hallux valgus).
-   **Corrective**: For supple deformities (e.g., CTEV).

#### Ankle Foot Orthoses

-   Position of the ankle directly affects knee position during gait and reduces energy consumption in conditions like polio and CP.
-   Types:
    -   **Posterior Leaf Spring**: Compensates for weak dorsiflexors; prevents excessive plantarflexion, no medio-lateral support.
    -   **Ground Reaction AFO (GRAFO)**: Wraps around the shin to prevent knee hyperextension by utilizing GRF.
    -   **Dynamic AFO (DAFO)**: Provides extensive support over most of the foot; effective in CP.
    -   **Metal-Plastic AFO**: Attaches to shoe or foot with ankle hinge, stops, and springs; controls motion in all directions but is bulky.

#### Knee Ankle Foot Orthoses

-   Extension of AFO with bars and a thigh band plus a mechanical knee joint.
-   Prevents knee instability; useful for individuals with paraplegia.

#### Patella Tendon Bearing Orthoses

-   Reduces weight bearing below the knee, used in fracture healing, ulcer treatment, and neuropathic joints & prosthetic sockets for BKA.

#### Hydrostatic Orthoses

-   E.g., Sarmiento humeral brace, which uses soft tissue circumferential pressure to create hydrostatic force, preventing fracture motion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Complications of Orthoses

-   **Psychosocial or Physical Complications**:
    -   **Compression Phenomena**: May cause pain, neuropathy, or venous congestion.
    -   **Heat and Skin Problems**: Can lead to maceration of the skin and secondary infections.
    -   **Dependence**: Reliance on a prosthesis even when it may not provide biomechanical benefits.
