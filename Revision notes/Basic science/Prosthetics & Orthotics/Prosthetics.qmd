### **Definition**

-   Prosthesis is a device designed to replace the function and appearance of a body part as much as possible.
-   Prosthesis technically embraces all substitutes for bodily defects

### Successful prosthetic use depends on patient and prosthesis factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Patient Factors

-   **Pre-morbid activity level**
-   **State of contra-lateral limb**
-   **Degree of trunk control and upper limb strength**
-   **Static and dynamic balance**
-   **Motivation to learn new skills**
-   **Other co-morbidities**

### Prosthetic Factors

-   **Ease of use**
-   **Aesthetic appearance**
-   **Durability and reliability**
-   **Comfort**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Upper Limb

-   Limb salvage is preferable, as a partially sensate limb is more functional than an insensate prosthesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Amputations**

### Pre-op Assessment of Achieving a Successful Wound

#### Nutrition

-   Poor indicators include:
    -   Albumin \< 3.5 g/dL
    -   Total lymphocyte count \< 1500
    -   Serum transferrin decreased

#### Vascularity

-   **ABPI**: \> 0.45
-   **Transcutaneous Oxygen tension**: \> 40 is a positive predictor (\< 20 negative)

#### Techniques

-   **Myoplastic**: Suture of muscles to each other.
-   **Myodesis**:
    -   Preferred option.
    -   Suture of muscle to the bone directly (periosteum or drill holes).
    -   Better fixation and muscle power.
    -   Prevents contracture formation.

#### General Technical Points

1.  Nerves sectioned cleanly under tension to prevent neuroma formation.
2.  Bone ends beveled and smooth.
3.  Avoid non-absorbable sutures except for skin.
4.  Scar away from bony edges and well healed before fitting.
5.  Stump shape should be conical or cylindrical.
6.  Avoid excessive soft tissue distal to the bone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Prosthetic Fitting

-   Should be done when wounds have healed, scar is mature, and edema and neuropathy controlled.
-   Excessive delay can also affect the outcome.
-   Skin desensitization programs are useful before fitting.
-   Early fitting (\<30 days) has a better outcome in the upper limb but must be balanced against having a stable wound.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Optimal Levels of Common Amputations

| Type | Optimum | Shortest | Longest |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Forearm (trans radial)** | Junction of proximal 2/3 and distal 1/3 forearm | 3 cm below biceps insertion | 5 cm above wrist to allow space for rotary prosthesis |
| **Humerus (trans humeral)** | Middle 1/3 arm | 4 cm below axillary fold | 10 cm above olecranon to allow space for elbow prosthesis |
| **Trans Femoral** | Middle 1/3 thigh | 8 cm below pubic ramus | 15 cm above knee joint to allow space for knee mechanism |
| **Trans Tibial** | 8 cm per 1 meter of height | 8 cm below knee joint | At any level, a myoplasty can be performed for cosmesis |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Disarticulation

### Advantages

-   Amputation retains the weight-bearing surface.
-   End-bearing stump may be harder wearing.
-   Bulbous shape assists suspension of the prosthesis.

#### Disadvantages

-   May compromise the choice of prosthetic available.
-   Prosthesis may appear bulky due to the bulbous shape of the stump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Classification of Prosthesis

| Category                | Description                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Level of amputation** | Trans femoral, transradial, etc.        |
| **Structure**           | Endo-skeletal (modular) or Exo-skeletal |
| **Function**            | Cosmetic or functional                  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Elements of Prostheses

| Element | Description |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Socket/Interface** | The connection between the prosthesis and residual limb, manufactured using computers or plaster mould. |
| **Suspension mechanism** | Attaches prosthesis to the residual limb. Can be a standard suction cup or elastomeric suction for an airtight seal. |
| **Struts/Pylons** | Restore limb length and connect socket to terminal device. |
| **Articulating Joints** | If needed, replace joint function. |
| **Terminal Device** | The most distal part of the prosthesis; either passive (better cosmesis) or active (more function). Active devices can be controlled by cables, struts, etc. or may be myoelectric, relying on action potentials from muscles. |
| **Active Devices** | Can be voluntary opening (closed at rest) or voluntary closing (open at rest). |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Upper Limb Prostheses

Upper limb prostheses aim to restore the 5 types of grip:

1.  **End Pinch**: Thumb against index finger.
2.  **Chuck Pinch (tripod)**: Thumb against index and middle finger.
3.  **Lateral Pinch**: Thumb against lateral aspect of the index finger.
4.  **Hook Power Grip**: E.g., carrying a suitcase.
5.  **Spherical Grip**: Turning a doorknob or light bulb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Prostheses

#### Prosthetic Feet

The terminal device for all lower limb prostheses - 5 types:

1.  **Single Axis Foot**
2.  **SACH Foot**
3.  **Dynamic Response Foot**
    -   Articulated
    -   Non-articulated

#### Single Axis Foot (non-energy storing)

-   Simple hinge allowing dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of the ankle.
-   Poor durability and cosmesis.

#### SACH Foot (Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel)

-   Non-energy conserving.
-   Was standard for a long time but now going out of vogue.
-   For low-demand patients and causes overloading on the other foot.

#### Dynamic Response Foot (energy storing)

-   Allows more normal activity and tailored to patients' needs.
-   Energy conserving.
-   Split into:
    -   **Articulated Dynamic Response Foot**: Best for general use; has a keel that deforms with loading and recoils to give a spring-like push-off; allows for inversion and eversion.
    -   **Non-Articulated Dynamic Response Foot**: High-demand prosthesis for running, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Trans-Tibial Prostheses

**Components**: - **Socket**: Traditionally patellar tendon bearing; now more often total contact or total surface bearing, distributing load more evenly over the residual limb. - **Suspension**: Different methods including suction, usually from the supracondylar area. - **Articulating Joint**: Ankle may be articulating or fixed in one position; terminal device as above for feet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Trans Femoral

**Socket**: - Shape is the key factor. - **Plug Fit**: Conventional socket onto end of stump. - **Ischial Tuberosity Bearing**: Q and H sockets (traditional); failed to prevent abduction. - **Ischial Ramal Socket (ischial containment)**: Attaches to ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, and inferior pubic ramus; modern socket that aims to keep hip adducted and provide tension in the gluteus medius, aiding stance.

**Suspension**: Various devices attaching to pelvis or residual stump.

**Terminal Device**: Foot as above.

**Articulating Joint**: The knee; needs to restore knee motion during gait to allow stance and swing. A combination of pneumatic devices, hydraulic devices, microprocessors, and locks/gravity assistance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Knee Articulation

| Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Polycentric (4 bar linkage)** | Moves COR allowing more flexion for sitting; good for transfemoral, bilateral, and knee disarticulations. |
| **Hydraulic/Pneumatic Knee** | Heavier but provides a more fluid gait; alters knee flexion resistance during the gait cycle; good for younger, more demanding patients. |
| **Constant Friction Knee** | A hinge with a screw or rubber pad that dampens flexion; common in children but gives poor stance control; relies on knee COR alignment for stability. |
| **Variable Friction (cadence control) Knee** | Has staggered pads; allows varied friction and varied walking speed; poor durability. |
| **Stance Phase Control (safety knee)** | Knee freezes to provide stability in stance by high friction; good for older patients or heavier patients. |
| **Manual Locking Knee** | Allows locking in extension to aid stance; used for very weak, unstable patients. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Knee and Ankle Disarticulations

-   Socket needs to accommodate the bulbous nature of the stump.
-   Sockets may be differential:
    -   Two-part with a changeable plaster molded insert.
    -   Windowed (window cut out of socket to accommodate stump).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hip Disarticulations and Trans Pelvic Amputations

-   These prostheses are bulky.
-   **Hip Disarticulation**: Can rely on the ischial tuberosity for socket support.
-   **Trans Pelvic**: Contralateral ischial tuberosity is required for support.
-   Knee articulation can be 4 bar, allowing it to fold anteriorly to allow the patient to sit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Trans Humeral and Elbow Disarticulations

-   **Munster Socket**: Supracondylar suspension.
-   Function is

achieved with voluntary opening and closing devices. - Loss of elbow function and shoulder complexity necessitates a thorough analysis of the residual limb and contra-lateral limb function to decide the best method for socket fabrication.

## **Proximal Transhumeral or Shoulder Disarticulations**

### Overview

-   Functionality is very poor due to the nature of the amputation.
-   A prosthetic universal shoulder joint is typically used and is controlled with the opposite hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Complications of Prostheses

#### Psychosocial and Physical Complications

1.  **Infection**
    -   Can lead to abscesses or sinuses.
    -   May require drainage or stump revision.
2.  **Neuroma**
    -   Can occur even with good surgical technique.
    -   Requires excision if symptomatic.
3.  **Dermatologic Issues**
    -   Skin problems can develop over the stump.
4.  **Phantom Sensation**
    -   Patients may feel that the limb is still present.
5.  **Phantom Pain**
    -   Neuropathic pain that originates from the amputated limb.
    -   Usually temporary and occurs early after amputation.
6.  **Choke Syndrome**
    -   Caused by venous congestion, leading to chronic venous changes in the stump.
    -   Improved with total contact prostheses, which eliminate dead spaces.
7.  **Pistoning in Transtibial Sockets**
    -   During stance: due to poor suspension method.
    -   During swing: due to poor socket fit, stump size reduction, and loosening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Energy Consumption by Amputation Level

| Amputation Type        | Energy Consumption (%) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Long Trans Tibial      | 10%                    |
| Trans Tibial           | 25%                    |
| Bilateral Trans Tibial | 30%                    |
| Short Trans Tibial     | 40%                    |
| Trans Femoral          | 65%                    |
| Hip Disarticulation    | 100%                   |
| Bilateral Transfemoral | 200%                   |

-   Note: Longer stumps generally result in reduced energy consumption, while shorter stumps lead to increased energy needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Knee hyperextension          | Heel too hard                              |
| Knee flexion                 | Heel too hard                              |
| Excessive lordosis           | Hip flexion contracture, socket problems   |

### Prosthetic Training

-   **Acquisition of the device**: Ideally, patients should be involved in the selection of the prosthesis.
-   **Training**: Should begin with basic activities and progress to more complex activities like walking on uneven terrain, stairs, or curbs.
-   **Psychological support**: Assists in adjusting to the new prosthetic limb.
