# Joint Friction & Lubrication

## Friction

-   **Definition**: The resistance to sliding between two bodies in contact due to:
    -   Adherence of surfaces to one another
    -   Viscosity of the fluid between them

### Three Laws of Friction:

1.  Frictional force = coefficient of friction x applied load
2.  Frictional force is independent of contact area and sliding speed
3.  Kinetic friction is independent of sliding speed

### Frictional Wear

-   Frictional wear is proportional to sliding distance
    -   F = xW
    -   Frictional force is proportional to the applied load
    -   x is the coefficient of friction of the two bearing surfaces
-   In a rotational system like a hip, frictional torque is more appropriate:
    -   **Frictional Torque** = Frictional force x Radius

### Asperities

-   **Asperities**: Projections that occur from any surface
    -   More asperities = more roughness

### Roughness

-   Expressed as **mean surface roughness**, i.e., mean asperity height

### Joint Contact Area

-   The contact point between the asperities comprises less than 1% of the apparent contact area
-   Asperities are compressed by contact
    -   Asperity deformation is inversely proportional to load and hardness of the material
    -   After prolonged contact, bonds form between the asperities
    -   Greater energy is required to overcome static friction than to maintain motion (dynamic friction)

### Mean Surface Roughness of Orthopaedic Materials

|----------------------|------------------------|
| Polished Exeter Stem | 0.01                   |
| Ceramic Head         | 0.02                   |
| Metal Head           | 0.025                  |
| Polyethylene Cup     | 2.0                    |
| Articular Cartilage  | 3.0                    |

### Co-efficients of Friction of Articulations

| Joint/Material        | Coefficient of Friction |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Native Knee           | 0.005                   |
| Native Hip            | 0.01                    |
| Metal on Polyethylene | 0.02                    |
| Metal on Metal        | 0.8                     |

## Joint Lubrication

### Synovial Fluid

-   Dialysate of blood, devoid of red cells, clotting factors, or hemoglobin
-   **Contents**:
    1.  Plasma Proteins
    2.  Lubricin
    3.  Hyaluronic Acid
    4.  Cells

### Cells

-   **Type A**: Important in phagocytosis
-   **Type B**: Fibroblast-like, produce synovial fluid
-   **Type C**: Intermediate, unclear role

### Hyaluronic Acid

-   Acts as an elastic solid during high impact due to tangled chains
-   Responsible for non-newtonian fluid properties, behaving like a viscoelastic solid

### Lubricin

-   The key lubricating element in the fluid

### Plasma Proteins

-   Contain proteinases, collagenase, and prostaglandins (PGs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Nutrition & Excretion

-   **Nutrients** enter synovium via diffusion through synovial micro-vessels

-   Plasma proteins diffuse out via lymphatics

-   The process is passive diffusion through the micro-vascular endothelium

-   Altered endothelial permeability (e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis) changes the balance of synovial fluid

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mechanics

-   **Viscosity**: The internal friction of a fluid
    -   Layers of fluid move against each other by shear forces

### Newtonâ€™s Law of Viscosity:

-   Viscosity = Shear stress / Shear rate

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Non-Newtonian Properties

-   Synovial fluid behaves in a non-newtonian fashion:
    1.  **Thixotropy**: Time-dependent decrease in viscosity under constant shearing
    2.  **Pseudo-plasticity**: Disproportionate change in viscosity with shear rate
-   Caused by hyaluronic acid molecules aligning, a phenomenon called **Shear Thinning**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Lubrication

-   **Boundary Lubrication**: Surfaces separated by a molecular thickness lubricant
-   **Fluid Film Lubrication**: The separating fluid film is thicker than the asperities of the surfaces

#### Boundary Lubrication

-   Occurs when fluid film lubrication is overcome (e.g., prolonged stance)
-   **Lubricin** forms a gel-like hydrophobic layer

#### Fluid Film Lubrication

-   Desirable as it prevents asperity contact and wear
-   Types of fluid film lubrication:
    1.  Hydrodynamic
    2.  Elastohydrodynamic
    3.  Micro-elastohydrodynamic
    4.  Weeping
    5.  Squeeze film lubrication
    6.  Boosted lubrication

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Fluid Film Lubrication

#### Hydrodynamic

-   Relies on surfaces not being perfectly parallel
-   Generates a fluid wedge during sliding, holding surfaces apart

#### Elastohydrodynamic

-   Predominant type in native articular cartilage
-   Deformation under load increases surface area, reducing shear rate and increasing viscosity

#### Micro-Elastohydrodynamic

-   Occurs under heavy loads, deforming cartilage asperities and improving lubrication

#### Squeeze Film Lubrication

-   Occurs when surfaces come into contact without sliding (e.g., heel strike)
-   Viscous fluid builds pressure, maintaining a gap between surfaces

#### Boosted Lubrication

-   Water from synovial fluid is pressurized into the cartilage, leaving a hyaluronic-rich fluid

#### Weeping Lubrication

-   Compression of surfaces results in tears of lubricant fluid

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gait Cycle Phase and Lubrication

| Gait Cycle Phase | Predominant Lubrication Type  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Initial Contact  | Squeeze Film                  |
| Stance           | Elastohydrodynamic            |
| Lift Off         | Boundary & Elastohydrodynamic |
| Swing            | Hydrodynamic                  |
| Prolonged Stance | Boundary, Boosted             |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lubrication in Prosthetic Joints

-   In native joints, all types of lubrication occur, but fluid film dominates

-   In prosthetic joints, boundary lubrication and some fluid film types occur (hydrodynamic, squeeze film)

-   **MoP**: Boundary lubrication dominates

-   **MoM & CoC**: Fluid film lubrication occurs due to increased radius

#### Wettability

-   Increased wettability = better lubrication
-   **Ceramics** are highly wettable, improving lubrication and reducing friction

#### Large Diameter Articulations

-   True fluid film lubrication may occur with large diameter bearings (e.g., MoM or ceramic bearings)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sommerfeld Number

-   A unitless number expressing the relationship between fluid film thickness, lubricant, and forces

### Lambda Ratio

-   Defines whether fluid film or boundary lubrication predominates
    -   3 = Pure fluid film
    -   \<1 = Pure boundary lubrication
    -   1-3 = Mixed lubrication

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Factors Affecting Lubrication:

1.  Type of load (low/high, sliding/static)
2.  Bearing surfaces (roughness, coefficient of friction, size, shape)
3.  Wettability (affinity for lubricating fluid)
4.  Velocity of motion (shear rate)
5.  Properties of the lubricant (viscosity, non-newtonian behavior)
