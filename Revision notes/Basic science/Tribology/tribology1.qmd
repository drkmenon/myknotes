# Tribology of Bearing Surfaces

## Polyethylene

### Chemistry

-   The basic monomer is C2H4.
-   Polymerized into a repeating chain by addition polymerization to give high-density polyethylene (HDP).
-   Free radicals are produced which attach to the carbon atom and then join to each other, creating a continuous chain.
-   Adjacent chains are held by weak van der Waals forces.

### How Can Strength Be Increased?

-   **Increasing Molecular Weight:** Higher molecular weight results in more chains.
-   **Creating Cross-links:** Cross-linking between chains increases strength.
-   **Reducing Crystallinity:** A lower crystallinity enhances flexibility and strength.

### Polyethylene Architecture

-   Differing structural areas within polyethylene:
    -   **Crystalline:** Organized 3-dimensional patterns of chains.
    -   **Amorphous:** Random entanglement of chains with a propensity for cross-linking.
-   Longer chains lead to a greater proportion of the amorphous area.
-   A greater amorphous area results in greater strength and wear resistance, forming the basis for UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene).
-   **Characteristics of UHMWPE:**
    -   Increased chain length.
    -   Increased number of chains.
    -   Increased proportion of amorphous areas.

### Cross-linking, Sterilization, and Storage of Polyethylene

-   Sterilization traditionally done by gamma irradiation in air.
-   Radiation encourages cross-linking between polyethylene chains, improving wear rates and tensile strength.
-   Irradiation generates free radicals that form cross-links, but:
    -   In the presence of oxygen, free radicals oxidize and degrade polyethylene.
    -   Oxidation reduces wear properties and occurs mainly in the subsurface white band (1-2mm).
    -   Over time, this layer increases in size, allowing further oxidation.
-   **Oxidation occurs if:**
    -   Polyethylene is sterilized in air or oxygen.
    -   Oxygen seeps into packaging over time (shelf life \> 2 years).
-   **Better Sterilization Methods:**
    -   Gamma irradiation in inert gas (argon or nitrogen) or in a vacuum.
    -   Sterilization using gas plasma or ethylene oxide (no radiation, no oxygen).

### Highly Cross-linked UHMWPE

-   Made by prolonged irradiation for even more cross-linking.
-   In vitro shows better wear rates than UHMPE.
-   However, increased cross-linking can lead to:
    -   Reduced fatigue resistance.
    -   Reduced fracture toughness.
-   Caution is advised regarding the use of highly cross-linked polyethylene, especially in total knee replacements (TKR), as failure often results from fatigue fractures rather than wear.

### Polyethylene Manufacturing

-   **Traditional Method:** RAM Bar extrusion, where a cylindrical ‘bar’ of polyethylene is machined into individual implants (especially for TKR).
-   **Issues with RAM Bar Extrusion:**
    -   Properties of produced implants differ according to their location within the bar.
-   **Solutions:**
    -   Calcium stearate is added to prevent yellowing and corrosion but may lead to fusion defects and worse wear properties.
-   **Other Manufacturing Options:**
    -   Compression molding followed by machining.
    -   Direct compression molding (DCM) is considered the gold standard.
    -   In DCM, polyethylene powder is directly compressed into a mold without further machining or additives, allowing for further irradiation in inert gas to promote cross-linking, resulting in optimal wear rates.

## Ceramics

### Types Used in Orthopaedics

-   **Zirconia:** Not used anymore due to high fracture rates and cost.
-   **Alumina:** Main ceramic used, improved quality compared to the first generation.
-   **Oxinium:** Oxidized zirconia.
-   **Hydroxyapatite:** Osteoconductive ceramic that aids in bone growth and bonding but can shear off implants and is difficult to coat.

### Manufacturing

-   Produced by pressing ceramic powder and water into a pre-fabricated cast.
-   Sintering (heating) is then done to increase density, but over-sintering leads to porosity and weakens the ceramic.
-   **Strength Dependence:** Strength is dependent on the original grain size; smaller grain size results in stronger ceramic.

### Material Properties

-   **Hard:** Third hardest material known.
-   **Stiff:** High modulus of elasticity.
-   **Inert:** Particles are not biologically active.
-   **Low Surface Roughness:** Smooth, reducing abrasive wear of polyethylene.
-   **Good Scratch Profile:** Less scratching leads to reduced wear.
-   **Wettable:** Better lubrication properties.
-   **Low Wear Characteristics:**
    -   Less linear wear.
    -   Less osteolysis due to smaller, less active particles.

### Limitations

-   **Brittle:** Virtually no plastic deformation before failure, posing a risk of fracture.
-   **Long-term Data:** Not yet available.
-   **Cost:** More expensive than alternatives.
-   **Squeaking:** May be caused by positioning or aging ceramics.

### Oxidized Zirconium

-   A metallic alloy of zirconium with a ceramic surface.
-   Oxidation in air converts the surface into ceramic, making it part of the material, not just a coating.
-   Provides properties similar to ceramics: hard, smooth, scratch-resistant, inert, and wettable.
-   Suitable for metal allergies due to low nickel content.
-   In vitro studies show greatly reduced polyethylene wear, but no long-term in vivo trials yet.

### Ceramic Fracture

-   Presence of third-body wear leads to plastic and particulate debris.
-   Revision should include synovectomy to remove all ceramic debris.
-   Damage to the Morse taper may necessitate revision to prevent catastrophic failure.
-   Ceramic particulate debris is typically not biologically active due to its small size, but third-body wear can produce more active debris.

## Metal on Metal (MoM) Articulations

-   **Historical Issues:** Equatorial bearing had high frictional torque, jamming, and high failure rates.
-   **Current Design:** Polar bearing with much lower frictional torque; requires a cup head clearance of 90-200 micrometers.
-   **Main Properties of MoM:**
    -   Fracture toughness.
    -   Hardness.
    -   Low roughness (smooth and polished).
    -   Small particle generation leads to low biological activity (50-100 nm).
    -   Self-healing capabilities; small scratches are polished out with articulation.
    -   Very resistant to abrasive wear.
    -   Osteolysis is not a major concern.

### Challenges

-   Produce a greater number of particles, particularly during the initial two years (bedding-in period).
-   **Wear Mode:** Primarily adhesive, which can be mitigated by using alloys with greater carbide content (e.g., adding molybdenum).

### Lubrication in MoM

-   Fluid film lubrication exists in MoM bearings, but problems include:
    -   Metal ion dissemination into the bloodstream.
    -   Potential carcinogenesis risks.
    -   Occurrence of metallosis, leading to adverse local tissue reactions (ALVAL) and pseudotumors.
-   MoM total hip replacements (THR) with large heads may experience wear at the taper due to size mismatch.
