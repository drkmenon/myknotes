### **Embryonic Stages and Germ Layers**

-   **17th Day of Gestation:**
    -   The embryo enters the triploblastic stage, consisting of three germ layers:
        -   **Endoderm**
        -   **Ectoderm**
        -   **Mesoderm**
    -   Through a process called **gastrulation**, these layers position themselves and begin interacting, setting the **anteroposterior axis** of the embryo and initiating neural development from the ectoderm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Formation of the Notochord and Neural Plate (Third Week)**

-   **Notochord Formation:**
    -   Appears during the **third week**.
    -   Acts as a foundation for the spinal column.
    -   Later transforms into the **nucleus pulposus** of intervertebral discs.
-   **Neural Plate and Neural Tube Formation:**
    -   The notochord induces the formation of the **neural plate**.
    -   By the **fourth week**, the neural plate folds into the **neural tube** through a process called **neurulation**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Somites and Spinal Development**

-   **Somite Formation:**
    -   Pairs of **somites** emerge from the mesoderm.
    -   **Sclerotome**: Becomes the vertebral body and annulus fibrosus.
    -   **Myotome**: Develops into muscles.
-   **Sclerotome Transformation (Fourth Week):**
    -   Surrounds the notochord to form vertebral bodies and annulus fibrosus.
    -   Grows around the neural tube to form **vertebral arches**.
    -   Inter-segmentation occurs:
        -   **Front half of one sclerotome** fuses with the **back half of the next** to form a single vertebra.

        -   This explains the segmental blood supply pattern.

### **Ossification Process of Vertebrae**

-   **7-8 Weeks Gestation:**
    -   Ossification begins, with the exception of C1 (atlas), C2 (axis), and the sacrum.
-   **Three Stages of Ossification:**
    -   Starts in the **lower thoracic** and **upper lumbar** regions.
    -   Progresses **cranially** and **caudally**.
    -   Cartilage centers form and unite to create:
        -   **Vertebral body**
        -   **Neural arch**
        -   **Apophyses** on the transverse and spinous processes.

#### **Key Developmental Stages**

| Stage    | Developmental Activity                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Week 3   | Formation of the notochord and initiation of the neural plate. |
| Week 4   | Neural plate folds into the neural tube, somites form.         |
| Week 7-8 | Ossification begins, centers form in vertebral regions.        |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Growth Zones in Vertebrae**

-   **Three growth zones** contribute to the structure of vertebrae:
    -   **Center of the vertebral body**
    -   **Neural arch**
    -   **Transverse and spinous processes**
-   Each vertebra results from approximately **100 growth plates**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Neurocentral Synchondrosis**

-   **Definition:**
    -   A growth plate located at the junction between the vertebral body and the pedicle.
-   **Role in Growth:**
    -   Critical for the development of the **vertebral body** and **posterior arch**.
-   **Developmental Timeline:**
    -   **Fusion by age 9** in humans, allowing for normal spinal development.
    -   **Intervention Impact:**
        -   Screw fixation crossing this plate before fusion can lead to **scoliosis** in growing animals, but not after the age of 10.

### **Key Milestones in Spinal Development**

| Developmental Stage | Key Event                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Week 17             | Triploblastic stage and gastrulation begin.    |
| Week 3              | Notochord formation, neural plate development. |
| Week 4              | Neural tube formation and somite development.  |
| Week 7-8            | Ossification of vertebrae begins.              |
| Age 9               | Neurocentral synchondrosis fuses.              |
