## Types of Growth Plates in a Long Bone

-   **Horizontal growth plate**: the Physis (primary ossification center).
-   **Spherical growth plate**: the Epiphysis (secondary ossification center).
    -   The epiphyseal growth plate has a similar arrangement but is less organized compared to the physis.

## The Physis

-   Composed of four zones, each with differently arranged chondrocytes.
-   Hypertrophic zone is subdivided into three zones:
    1.  Reserve Zone
    2.  Proliferative Zone
    3.  Hypertrophic Zone:
        -   Hypertrophic Maturation Zone
        -   Hypertrophic Degenerative Zone
        -   Provisional Zone of Calcification
    4.  Metaphysis:
        -   Primary Spongiosa
        -   Secondary Spongiosa

### Characteristics of the Zones

-   The chondrocytes in each zone behave differently.
-   Blood supply, matrix density, and oxygen tension vary across the zones.

### Reserve Zone

-   Sparse, small cells.
-   Thick, strong extracellular matrix surrounds chondrocytes.
-   High Type 2 collagen content.
-   Contains germinal stem cells but inactive.
-   Low oxygen tension.
-   Blood supply comes directly from the epiphyseal artery.
-   Cells store nutrients in preparation for proliferation.

### Proliferative Zone

-   Chondrocytes proliferate, influenced by mechanical and hormonal factors.
-   Cells are disc-like and align into longitudinal columns.
-   Matrix becomes less organized.
-   The uppermost cell in the column is a progenitor cell.
-   Responsible for longitudinal growth, with the number of cell divisions proportional to growth.
-   High oxygen tension.
-   Epiphyseal artery terminates in the uppermost cells but does not penetrate into the zone.

### Hypertrophic Zone

-   Chondrocytes enlarge, and extracellular matrix decreases, making this the weakest zone, prone to fractures.
-   Avascular and low oxygen tension.
-   Influenced by hormones and local growth factors like Indian hedgehog, parathyroid-related peptide, growth hormone, thyroid hormones, steroids, and sex hormones.
-   Provisional zone of calcification: matrix calcification begins here, and alkaline phosphatase and Type 10 collagen are secreted.
-   Programmed cell death of chondrocytes occurs.

### Metaphysis

#### Primary Spongiosa

-   Capillary plexus brings osteoblasts, which lay down woven bone on the cartilage matrix (endochondral ossification).

#### Secondary Spongiosa

-   Osteoclasts and osteoblasts work together, resorbing woven bone and laying down lamellar bone.

## Periphery of the Growth Plate

-   **Groove of Ranvier**: Contains osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts; responsible for circumferential growth of the physis.
-   **Perichondral Ring of La Croix**: Strong fibrous structure anchoring the physis to the epiphysis and metaphysis.

## Physeal Blood Supply

-   Primary supply from the perichondrial artery.
-   Epiphyseal artery invades the reserve zone and ends in the proliferative zone.
-   Metaphyseal arteries invade the provisional zone of calcification.
-   The hypertrophic zone is completely avascular.

## Growth Plate Biomechanics

-   The growth plate is the weakest part of a long bone.
-   The hypertrophic zone is the weakest part of the growth plate.

### Heuter-Volkmann's Law

-   Increased compression through the physis leads to decreased growth.
-   Growth plate shape is determined by the forces acting on it.

## Normal Physeal Growth

### Upper Limb

-   Most growth occurs away from the elbow.
-   80% of humeral growth is proximal, while 75% of radial growth is distal.

### Lower Limb

-   70% of lower limb growth occurs around the knee.
    -   Distal femur \> Proximal tibia \> Distal tibia \> Proximal femur.
-   Leg grows 23 mm per year (femur 12 mm, tibia 9 mm).

### Growth Rates in the Last 5-6 Years

-   Distal femur: 9 mm/year.
-   Proximal tibia: 6 mm/year.
-   Distal tibia: 5 mm/year.
-   Proximal femur: 3 mm/year.

## Elbow Growth

-   CRITOL describes the order of ossification center appearance.
-   Capitellum appears between 1 month and 18 months, followed by each subsequent center at two-year intervals.
-   Ossification centers appear and fuse earlier in girls.
-   Fusion occurs in a different order, with the medial epicondyle and olecranon being the last.

## Foot Growth

-   Foot bones are largely cartilage at birth, allowing for potential remodeling (e.g., Ponseti treatment).
-   All tarsal bones have one ossification center except the calcaneus, which has a secondary center posteriorly (appears around age 8).
-   Calcaneus anterior center, talus, and cuboid are present at birth.
-   Cuneiforms (lateral, then middle, then intermediate) and navicular appear each year after birth.
-   2nd to 5th metatarsals have primary centers in the shaft and secondary centers at the head.
-   1st metatarsal has its primary center in the shaft and secondary center at the base.

## Acetabulum

-   The triradiate cartilage shapes according to stresses (Volkmann's law). Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) leads to dysplasia and a smaller femoral head.
-   Triradiate and femoral head epiphysis fuse by age 8, with corrective osteotomies being more effective before this age.
-   Acetabular fractures in children may cause traumatic arrest and secondary dysplasia.

## Ilium

-   Crest fuses laterally to medially (used to assess the Risser stage in scoliosis).

## Diseases Affecting the Growth Plate

### Achondroplasia

-   Altered Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) affects the proliferative zone, impairing longitudinal growth.
-   Intramembranous and appositional ossification are unaffected, leading to macrocephaly, frontal bossing, and limb shortening.

### Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia & Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia

-   Affect the epiphysis, causing small, weakened epiphyses.

### Trevor's Disease

-   Epiphyseal hyperplasia leads to epiphyseal osteochondromas, usually affecting the ankle and knee.

### Rickets

-   Affects the hypertrophic zone, with failure of calcification in the provisional zone of calcification.
-   Leads to a widened, hazy, and thick physis with metaphyseal flaring (cupping).
