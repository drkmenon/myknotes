### Definition:

`Bone is a specialised Connective tissue`[^1].

[^1]: This is the standard answer for all questions about the definition of any living tissue we deal with in Orthopaedics: **it is a specialised connective tissue.**

Bone includes cells and extracellular matrix. Most common type of collagen is seen bone is *Type 1 collagen* [^2]

**Bone Functions**

1.  Primary Calcium Reservoir\
2.  Haemopoesis\
3.  Mechanical Support for Soft Tissues and Organs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bone Structure**

1.  Woven (Immature)\
2.  Lamellar (Mature)
    -   **Cortical Bone**\
    -   **Cancellous Bone**\
3.  Periosteum

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Woven Bone (Immature)

**Features**\
- Disorganized haphazard collagen arrangement\
- Weaker\
- Contains more cells than lamellar bone per unit volume\
- Isotropic: Properties do not vary despite the type of loading\
- High turnover

**Examples**\
- Embryonic and neonatal skeleton\
- Paediatric callus is mainly woven\
- Metaphysis up to 4 years old\
- Early hard callus in adults\
- Pathologic high turnover bone (e.g. tumor, Paget’s, osteogenesis)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lamellar Bone (Cortical & Cancellous)

**General Features**\
- Stronger\
- Collagen fibers stress-orientated, arranged in parallel sheets of lamellae\
- Herring bone structure\
- Adjacent lamellae oblique to each other\
- Cement lines exist between lamellae, which are potential weak points\
- Anisotropic: Properties vary depending on mechanical stress\
- Fewer cells per unit volume\
- Composed mainly of matrix laid down by osteoblasts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cortical Bone

-   Makes up 80% of bone density in the body\
-   20x denser than cancellous (Young's Modulus 20 GPa)\
-   Arranged into multiple longitudinal osteons\
-   Resists torsion and bending better than cancellous bone

**Osteon (Harvesian System)**\
- The fundamental unit of lamellar bone\
- Comprises 5 or 6 concentric lamellar rings running longitudinally around a central Haversian canal\
- Each osteon is 50 μm in diameter\
- Cement lines between osteons are potential sites of weakness

**Haversian Canal**\
- Formed by 5 or 6 lamellar rings\
- Contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics

**Volkmann’s Canals**\
- Perpendicular to the Haversian canals\
- Contain blood vessels and allow communication between periosteal and intramedullary blood vessels

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cancellous Bone

-   Found in metaphyses and epiphyses\
-   Forms a 3D trabecular lattice\
-   Still arranged in lamellar fashion\
-   No Haversian systems\
-   Lower tensile strength, more elastic (Young's Modulus 1 GPa)\
-   8x higher turnover due to larger surface area\
-   More subject to Wolff’s Law (remodeling according to mechanical stress)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Periosteum

-   **Inner Osteogenic Layer**: Vascular\
-   **Outer Structural Layer**: Fibrous\
-   Responsible for bone growth in diameter

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cells of Bone

**Osteoblasts**\
- Formed by osteoprogenitor cells (mesenchymal stem cells)\
- Secrete osteoid (organic bone matrix)\
- Type 1 collagen, RANKL, OPG, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein\
- Have receptors for:\
- Parathyroid hormone, Vitamin D3, glucocorticoids, estrogen, prostaglandins\
- Life span: 100 days\
- Afterward, they either undergo apoptosis, become bone lining cells, or become osteocytes

**Osteocytes**\
- Inactive osteoblasts trapped in lacunae & canaliculi\
- Maintain bone and alter matrix in their vicinity\
- High nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio\
- Play a role in calcium and PTH homeostasis

**Bone Lining Cells**\
- Flat, inactive osteoblasts\
- Reactivate in times of increased bone turnover

**Osteoclasts**\
- Function: Bone resorption\
- Derived from monocytes\
- Activated by RANKL secreted by osteoblasts\
- Secrete acid (carbonic anhydrase) to dissolve hydroxyapatite crystals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bone Matrix

-   **Inorganic (60%)**
    -   Calcium hydroxyapatite \[Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2\]\
    -   Responsible for compressive strength of bone\
    -   99% of total body calcium is stored in bone\
-   **Organic (40%)**
    -   90% Type 1 collagen, 10% BMPs, cytokines, growth factors\
    -   Provides tensile strength

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Blood Supply of Bone

-   5-10% of cardiac output goes to bone\
-   3 main sources:
    1.  **Nutrient Artery System**: Dominant in adults\
    2.  **Periosteal System**: Dominant in children\
    3.  **Metaphyseal/Epiphyseal System**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bone Metabolism

**Calcium**\
- 99% stored in bone, main source from diet\
- Functions in bone mineralization, nerve, muscle, and clotting function\
- Calcium absorption actively in the duodenum, passively in the jejunum

**Phosphate**\
- 85% stored in bone within hydroxyapatite crystals\
- Absorbed mainly in the duodenum

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Calcium and Phosphate Regulation

**Main Hormones**\
- Vitamin D, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Calcitonin

**Vitamin D**\
- Increases calcium and phosphate absorption\
- Stimulates osteoclastic resorption indirectly\
- Inhibits PTH production

**PTH**\
- Produced by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland\
- Increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphate

**Calcitonin**\
- Directly inhibits osteoclasts\
- Produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Markers of Bone Activity

1.  **Alkaline Phosphatase**: Elevated during bone formation\
2.  **Urinary Hydroxyproline & Hydroxypyridoline**: Elevated during bone resorption
