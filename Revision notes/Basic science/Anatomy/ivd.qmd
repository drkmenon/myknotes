title: "Intervertebral disc"
---

## Embryology

-   Vertebral column and discs develop at 4 weeks.
-   Two adjacent sclerotomes combine to form pre-cartilaginous vertebral body.
-   Mesenchymal cells lie between the vertebrae.
-   Notochord forms the nucleus pulposus.
-   Circular fibers form around this to create the annulus fibrosus.
-   The disc is a secondary cartilaginous joint.

## Structure

-   Discs get larger more caudally, with the largest being L4/5.
-   Thicker anteriorly in cervical and lumbar spine, contributing to lordosis.
-   L5/S1 is the most avascular disc and thickest anteriorly.

### Annulus

#### Outer Annulus

-   Smaller in size.
-   Made of Type 1 collagen in lamellae.
-   Adjacent lamellae are obliquely oriented with respect to each other.
-   Resists tensile and shear stresses.
-   Contains fibroblasts and nerves.
-   Attached to anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL).

#### Inner Annulus

-   Larger in size.
-   More Type 2 collagen.
-   No lamellar organization.
-   Contains chondrocytes.

### Nucleus Pulposus

-   Made of Type 2 collagen.
-   Rich in mucoid proteoglycan matrix.
-   Proteoglycans (PGs) attract water, accounting for 80% content.
-   PGs provide compressive strength.
-   The matrix gives visco-elastic and anisotropic properties.
-   Greater stiffness with rapid loading.
-   Elasticity and resistance to compression.

### Attachment to Vertebrae

-   Outer 1/3 of the disc connects directly via Sharpey's fibers, forming a ring apophysis.
-   Inner 2/3 folds in to contribute to the vertebral end plate.

### End Plate

-   Covered with hyaline cartilage in young individuals.
-   Changes to calcified cartilage with age.
-   No fibrillar connections between the end plate and vertebra.
-   Vulnerable to shear stresses.

### Collagens Present in the Disc

-   **Type 5**, **Type 6** (unique to intervertebral disc), **Type 9-12**.
    -   Type 1 in outer annulus.
    -   Transition to Type 2 more centrally.
    -   Type 6 is unique to discs.

## Nerve Supply

-   Only the outer annulus has a nerve supply.
-   Dorsal: Sinuvertebral nerves (branches of spinal nerves).
-   Ventral: Sympathetic chain.

## Blood Supply and Nutrition

-   Capillary plexus on the surface of the disc.
-   Nutrition is via diffusion through the end plates.

## Age-Related Changes

-   Disc becomes dehydrated and fibrotic over time.
-   Nucleus pulposus is replaced by fibrocartilage.
-   PG content decreases.
-   Chondroitin sulfate decreases.
-   Chondroitin-keratin sulfate ratio decreases.
-   Water content drops.
-   Relative collagen content increases.
-   Disc becomes unable to resist load.
-   Nucleus starts behaving more like a solid.
-   Fissures and cracks develop in the annulus.
-   Alters mechanical properties of the spine.
-   Destabilizes the spinal motion segment.

### Consequences of Age-Related Changes

-   Facet joint degeneration.
-   Risk of disc herniation.
-   Ligamentum flavum buckling.
-   Further loss of disc height.
    -   Narrowing of neural foraminae, leading to foraminal/recess stenosis.
    -   Further facet arthrosis.
    -   Flavum hypertrophy.
    -   Canal stenosis.
    -   Degenerative spondylolisthesis.

## Disc Function

-   Primary source of spinal mobility.
-   Resists tensile, compressive, and shear stresses while maintaining movement.
-   **Anatomic Properties**:
    -   Outer annulus resists shear and torsion due to alternating lamellar structure and Type 1 collagen.
    -   Nucleus pulposus and inner annulus better resist compression, converting compression to radial forces.
    -   These forces generate hoop stresses in the annulus.
-   The disc functions as a **biphasic material**.
    -   Outer annulus undergoes hoop stresses in compression.
    -   Inner layers act as shock absorbers, dissipating stresses.

## Disc Injury and Healing

### Herniation

-   Annular tear starts in the inner annulus due to sudden increases in intradiscal pressure.
-   Pain arises from the nuclear part bulging through the tear and irritating nerves in the outer annulus.
-   If the tear propagates to the outer annulus, bulging or herniation occurs, causing pain from the disc and nerve root impingement.
-   90% of herniations are asymptomatic at 3 months due to:
    -   Resorption of nucleus material.
    -   Annular tear does not repair itself.

### Disc Degeneration

-   Occurs with age due to chronic dehydration of the disc and impaired nutrition.
-   PG content decreases, reducing water content.
-   Relative collagen content increases.
-   Decreased vascularity and progressive calcification of endplates impair diffusion.
-   End plate microfractures occur, permanently deforming the disc.
    -   The disc loses its elastic properties and behaves like a solid.
    -   Alters mechanics and load distribution, leading to osteophyte formation, facet joint arthrosis, and pain.
