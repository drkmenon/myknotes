### **Composition of Articular Cartilage**

Articular cartilage is composed of different components that contribute to its structure and function. The table below outlines the wet and dry weight distribution of these components:

| **Component** | **Wet Weight** | **Dry Weight** |
|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Water** | 75% | \- |
| **Collagen** | 20% | 70% |
| **Chondrocytes** | 5% | \- |
| **Proteoglycans** | 10% | \- |
| **Other** | \- | Glycoproteins, enzymes, extracellular ions |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Structure of Articular Cartilage**

Articular cartilage consists of individual chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix, forming a 3D cartilaginous framework. It is organized into four layers:

1.  **Superficial Gliding Zone**
    -   Thinnest layer with the highest collagen and water content.\
    -   Lowest proteoglycan content.\
    -   Collagen fibers run parallel to the surface, providing resistance to shear stress and high tensile stiffness.\
    -   Covered by **Lamina Splendens**, a protective film.
2.  **Middle Transitional Zone**
    -   Collagen fibers arranged obliquely.\
    -   Acts as a transition zone for shear forces and compressive forces.
3.  **Deep Radial Zone**
    -   Thickest zone with the highest proteoglycan concentration and low collagen content.\
    -   Collagen fibers are arranged perpendicular to the surface, making it resistant to compressive forces.
4.  **Calcified Zone**
    -   Contains calcified cartilage and is anchored to subchondral bone by hydroxyapatite crystals.\
    -   Virtually no type 2 collagen; mostly type 10 collagen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Collagen in Articular Cartilage**

**Collagen synthesis** occurs both inside and outside chondrocytes, leading to the formation of **collagen fibers**. The synthesis process involves:

-   Formation of polypeptide chains within chondrocytes.
-   Assembly of a triple helix structure called **Pro-collagen** in the Golgi apparatus.
-   Release of pro-collagen into the extracellular matrix, where it forms **Tropo-Collagen**.
-   Tropo-Collagen crosslinks to form collagen fibers.

**Type 2 Collagen** is the most abundant, making up 90% of cartilage collagen. It is stable with a half-life of 25 years and provides tensile strength.

**Other Types of Collagen:** - **Type 10 Collagen**: Found in the calcified zone, associated with cartilage calcification. - **Type 11 Collagen**: Regulates fiber diameter and holds the lattice together. - **Type 9 Collagen**: Present on the cartilage surface. - **Type 6 Collagen**: Carries shear stresses and increases in osteoarthritis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Proteoglycans**

Proteoglycans are large, hydrophilic molecules that interact with water, providing cartilage with compressive strength. The most common proteoglycan is **Aggrecan**, which forms aggregates with **hyaluronic acid**, enhancing water retention and interactions with collagen.

**Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)** are proteoglycan subunits: - **Chondroitin Sulfate**: Decreases with age but increases in osteoarthritis. - **Keratin Sulfate**: Increases with age.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Chondrocytes**

Chondrocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into articular or physeal chondrocytes. Their primary functions include: 1. Collagen production. 2. Proteoglycan production. 3. Enzyme secretion for cartilage metabolism (metalloproteinases).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Nutrition and Nerve Supply**

-   **Avascular**: Articular cartilage lacks blood vessels and receives nutrients through diffusion from the synovial fluid.
    -   **Loading** of joints helps squeeze out waste, while unloading allows nutrient diffusion.
-   **Aneural**: Cartilage has no nerve supply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Function of Articular Cartilage**

1.  **Joint Lubrication**
2.  **Shock Absorption**

Articular cartilage has excellent **biomechanical properties**: - Low friction (more effective than joint replacements). - 10 times more efficient at shock absorption than bone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Cartilage Lubrication**

-   **Fluid Film Lubrication**: Dominant during movement, particularly elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication.
-   **Boundary Lubrication**: Acts during rest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Pathological States of Cartilage**

-   **Superficial Lacerations**: Do not heal due to avascularity.
-   **Deep Lacerations**: Heal by fibrocartilage formation but cannot bear repetitive loading as effectively as type 2 collagen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Changes in Cartilage with Aging and Osteoarthritis**

| **Parameter** | **Aging** | **Osteoarthritis** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Water Content** | Decreases | Increases |
| **Synthetic Activity** | Decreases | Increases |
| **Collagen Content** | Decreases | Decreases (concentration increases) |
| **Proteoglycan Content** | Decreases | Decreases |
| **Chondrocyte Size** | Increases | \- |
| **Chondrocyte Number** | Decreases | \- |
| **Chondroitin: Keratin Ratio** | Decreases | Increases |
| **Stiffness (Youngâ€™s Modulus)** | Increases | Decreases (due to high water content) |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Osteoarthritis**

Osteoarthritis develops due to two primary mechanisms: 1. **Increased degrading enzyme concentration**. 2. **Direct trauma to cartilage**.

The condition leads to:

-   Damaged collagen meshwork.

<!-- -->

-   Increased water content and proteoglycan synthesis.

<!-- -->

-   Compromised load

<!-- -->

-   bearing ability, leading to cartilage fatigue and eventual degeneration.
