# **Osteopetrosis (Marble Bone Disease)**

\
Osteopetrosis is characterized by **increased bone sclerosis** due to deficient osteoclast activity, leading to brittle yet sclerotic bones.

### Types of Osteopetrosis

1.  **Autosomal Recessive (Infantile Malignant)**
    -   Severe form, often leading to death in infancy.
2.  **Autosomal Dominant (Benign)**
    -   Also known as **Albers-Schonberg disease**.
    -   Typically diagnosed incidentally after a fracture or X-ray.

### Diagnosis

-   Diagnosis of the **benign type** is usually incidental, especially after fractures or cranial X-rays.
-   Additional findings may include:
    -   **Anemia**
    -   **Cranial nerve palsies**, such as hearing loss.

### Histology

-   Osteoclasts lack the typical **ruffled border**.
-   Presence of **calcified bars within mature trabeculae**.

### X-ray Features

-   **Loss of medullary cavities** due to sclerosis.
-   **Bone within a bone** appearance.
-   **Symmetric, uniform sclerosis**.

### Treatment

-   **Interferon**
-   **Bone marrow transplant** for the malignant infantile type.

# **Paget's Disease of Bone**

\
Paget's disease is a metabolic disorder involving **overactivity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts**, leading to abnormal bone formation.

### Epidemiology

-   Men are slightly more affected.
-   Common in regions such as the **USA** and **UK**.
-   Increases with age: affects 3% of people over 40 years and 10% over 80 years.

### Types

1.  **Monostotic**: Affects one bone (20% of cases).
2.  **Polystotic**: Affects multiple bones (80% of cases).

### Causes

-   **Viral-induced**: Linked to paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and canine distemper virus.
-   **Genetic**: Some hereditary predisposition.

### Pathophysiology

-   Initial problem lies in **osteoclasts**, which increase in size and number, becoming overactive.
-   **Osteoblasts** respond by increasing activity, leading to accelerated but disorganized bone formation.

### Phases of Paget's Disease

1.  **Lytic Phase**: Dominated by osteoclast activity, causing bone lysis.
2.  **Active Phase**: Osteoblast activity increases, resulting in mixed sclerotic and lytic areas.
3.  **Burnt-out Phase**: Residual effects of the active stage; the bone appears coarse with a mosaic-like trabeculae.

### Clinical Presentation

-   **Asymptomatic** in 95% of cases, with many diagnoses being incidental.
-   **Fractures**: Slower healing fractures, requiring fixation.
-   **Arthritis**: Commonly affects the hip and knee, leading to protrusio acetabuli.
-   **Bone Pain**: Uncommon but can indicate high turnover or malignancy (e.g., osteosarcoma).
-   **Nerve Compression**: Spinal stenosis or hearing loss.
-   **Deformities**: Bowing of long bones (e.g., **Sabre tibia**).
-   **Cardiac Failure**: Due to high vascularity of the bone.
-   **Gout**: Due to increased protein metabolism.
-   **Malignant Transformation**: Increased risk of osteosarcoma.

### X-ray Features

-   **Widened bones**: A compensatory response.
-   **Pathologic/stress fractures**.
-   **Blade/flame sign**: Seen in the lytic stage.
-   **Mosaic-like pattern**: Mixed sclerotic and lytic areas.
-   **Deformities** and **secondary osteoarthritis**.
-   **Hip protrusio**: Protrusion of the acetabulum into the pelvic cavity.

### Laboratory Findings

-   **Normal calcium levels**.
-   **Elevated alkaline phosphatase**: Reflects increased osteoblast activity.
-   **Elevated acid phosphatase**: Reflects increased osteoclast activity.
-   **Urinary collagen peptides and hydroxyproline**: Indicate high collagen turnover.

### Histology

-   **Mosaic-like bone marrow**.
-   **Scanty cells**.

### Bone Scan

-   Shows **high uptake** in areas of active disease.

### Treatment Options

Treatment is indicated for: - **Pathologic fractures** - **Bone pain** - **Nerve/spinal compression** - **Osteoarthritis** - **Cardiac failure** due to high output - **Gout** - **Pre-surgery** to reduce bleeding risk.

#### Medical Treatment

1.  **Bisphosphonates**: Inhibits osteoclast overactivity.
2.  **Calcitonin**: Less commonly used due to side effects.

#### Surgical Treatment

-   **Fracture fixation** is preferred due to long healing times.
-   **Arthroplasty**: For joint involvement.
-   **Nerve decompression**: In cases of nerve compression.
-   **Malignant transformation treatment**: For osteosarcoma or other sarcomas.

### Malignant Transformation

-   **30x increased risk of osteosarcoma**, especially in long-standing polystotic disease.
-   May also develop fibrosarcoma or chondrosarcoma.
-   Prognosis: **50% survival** rate for osteosarcoma.
