### Orthopaedic Metallurgy

#### Molecular Structure of Metals

-   Metals consist of crystalline structures made up of millions of crystalline grains, which contain molecular lattices.
-   Three types of defects can affect the mechanical properties of bulk metal:
    1.  **Grain Boundaries**: Connections between adjacent crystals; they limit crack and dislocation propagation but are sites of weakness.
    2.  **Dislocations**: Defects within individual crystals where the 2-D lattice stops abruptly; under stress, these dislocations propagate, leading to plastic deformation.
    3.  **Cracks**: Volumetric voids within individual crystals that can significantly impact mechanical properties.
-   Manufacturing processes and post-manufacture quality control aim to manage these defects to create metals with desired properties.

#### Alloys

-   Alloys are combinations of elemental metals that improve mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, or biocompatibility compared to their individual components.
-   Ductility can be reduced by:
    1.  Adding large metal ions that prevent lattice layers from slipping.
    2.  Adding small ions (e.g., carbon) that fill gaps between lattices and hinder slipping.
-   Adding carbon to steel increases brittleness, hence low-carbon steel is preferred for implants.

#### Addition of Other Elements

-   **Nickel & Chromium**: Increase corrosion resistance.
-   **Cobalt & Molybdenum**: Enhance material strength.

#### Manufacture of Metals

1.  **Machining**: Final finishing process using lathes or mills.
2.  **Casting**: Molten metal is poured into a mold and allowed to cool. Grain size affects properties:
    -   Rapid cooling yields smaller grains (harder but more brittle).
    -   Slow cooling produces larger grains (more ductile).
    -   Not commonly used in orthopaedics due to control difficulties.
3.  **Forging**: Most common method for implant manufacture.
    -   Applies pressure to shape metal, aligning grain boundaries and improving mechanical properties.
    -   Can be done through:
        -   **Cold Working**: Room temperature, increases strength but reduces ductility and increases brittleness.
        -   **Hot Working**: Above crystallization temperature, easier to shape, maintains ductility, and can be hardened later.

#### Heat Treatments

1.  **Annealing**: Heats metal above crystallization temperature to alter dislocation patterns and grain boundaries, followed by controlled cooling to improve ductility and workability.
2.  **Quenching**: Sudden immersion in cold water to trap impurities and harden the material.
3.  **Tempering**: Re-heating to lower temperatures after quenching to reduce brittleness.

#### Coatings and Surface Finishes

| **Finish**     | **Process**         | **Roughness (µm)** | **Materials** |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Polished       | Mechanical abrasion | 0.1                | Any           |
| Matte          | Mechanical abrasion | 0.8                | Any           |
| Grit Blasted   | Mechanical abrasion | 3                  | Any           |
| Sintered Beads | Sintering           | 150                | CoCr          |
| Plasma Spray   | Plasma spraying     | 50-150             | HA, Tantalum  |
| Porous Metals  | Vapour deposition   | 150-250            | Tantalum      |

1.  **Grit Blasting**: Uses hard metallic crystals to give a rough finish for better cement interdigitation.
2.  **Sintered Beads**: Increase surface roughness by applying heated metal beads, often CoCr, to implants.
3.  **Plasma Spray Coating**: Uses high-temperature torches to heat coating material into plasma, which is then sprayed onto implants.

#### Common Orthopaedic Metals

An ideal orthopaedic material should be fatigue resistant, biocompatible, resistant to corrosion, and sufficiently strong, ductile, and stiff.

    -   Mechanical Properties:
        -   Good fatigue resistance and relatively biocompatible.
        -   High stiffness and hardness, ductility allows contouring of plates.
        -   Susceptible to galvanic corrosion and nickel hypersensitivity.

    -   Mechanical Properties:
        -   Less stiff than CoCr and steel, good fatigue resistance.
        -   Low surface hardness and highly notch-sensitive.
        -   Excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility.
        -   MRI and CT safe with minimal image distortion.

        -   Good fatigue strength and ultimate tensile strength.
        -   Low surface roughness and relatively corrosion-resistant.
        -   Used as articulating components but can lead to ion dissemination and metal hypersensitivity.
4.  **Tantalum**

    -   Mechanical Properties:
        -   Low modulus of elasticity similar to cancellous bone.
        -   High porosity (up to 80%) allowing for rapid bone ingrowth.
        -   Not suitable for stems due to lower strength and fatigue resistance.
