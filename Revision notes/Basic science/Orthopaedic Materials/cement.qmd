#### Components

| **Part**   | **Composition**                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Liquid** | Monomer - Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)      |
|            | Accelerator – N-Dimethyltoludine         |
|            | Inhibitor – Hydroquinone                 |
| **Powder** | Polymer - Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) |
|            | Initiator – Benzoyl Peroxide             |
|            | Barium Sulphate                          |
|            | Dye – Chlorophyll                        |
|            | Antibiotics                              |

#### Chemical Reaction

-   Polymerization occurs on mixing.
-   The reaction is exothermic (releases heat).

#### Phases of Cement Polymerization

| **Phase** | **Features** |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mixing Phase** | Performed homogeneously in a vacuum to reduce porosity. |
| **Waiting (Dough) Phase** | From mixing until cement is no longer doughy. Viscosity increases. Too low viscosity allows blood to mix into the cement. |
| **Working Phase** | Cement can be manipulated. This is the difference between doughy and setting times. |
| **Hardening Phase** | Cement completely hardens. Temperature of stem, cement, and environment influences this. |
| **Setting Time** | From mixing until the cement reaches half of its maximal heat. |

#### Macroscopic Stages

1.  **Sandy**: Powder and liquid mix appear grainy and separate.
2.  **Stringy**: Cement sticks to gloves.
3.  **Doughy**: Cement no longer sticks to gloves, marking the start of its working time.
4.  **Final**: Cement becomes hard and hot.

#### Mechanical Properties of Cement

1.  Weak tensile strength.
2.  Moderate shear strength.
3.  Strong compressive strength.
4.  Young’s modulus between cortical and cancellous bone.
5.  Brittle nature.
6.  Highly notch-sensitive.
7.  Viscoelastic – shows creep and stress relaxation.

-   Reaches ultimate strength within 24 hours.
-   Functions as a grout, not an adhesive.
-   Depends on mechanical interlocking with bone.

#### Factors Affecting Cement Properties

1.  **Atmospheric**
    -   **Temperature & Humidity**: Increased humidity and temperature reduce setting time.
2.  **Mixing Technique**
    -   Vacuum or centrifuge mixing reduces porosity.
    -   Reduced porosity increases mechanical strength.
3.  **Implantation Technique**
    -   Pressurization increases interdigitation.
    -   Retention of cancellous bone.
    -   Blood or soft tissue interposition can interfere.
    -   Voids or stress riser formation can lead to failure.
    -   Sharp-edged implants and bone-implant contact can cause issues.
    -   Centralization improves stability.
4.  **Cement Composition**
    -   Barium for radiopacity.
    -   Antibiotics may increase porosity.
    -   Less than 2:1 ratio of powder to liquid (more liquid) reduces setting time.

#### Complications of Bone Cement Use

1.  **Heat Generation**
    -   Thicker mantles or smaller surface areas increase heat generation.
    -   Excessive heat can cause bone necrosis.
2.  **Systemic Effects**
    -   Cement implantation can cause transient but severe hypotension.
    -   Likely due to micro-embolization of fat and cement rather than chemical mediation.
3.  **Cement Fracture**
    -   Occurs due to crack formation and propagation through the mantle.
    -   Cement is highly notch-sensitive.

#### Commonly Used Cements

| **Cement** | **Details** |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Palacos R** | Contains Zirconium Dioxide as its radio-opaque element. Antibiotic version: Palacos RG (Gentamicin). |
| **Simplex P** | Contains Barium Sulphate as the radio-opaque agent. Antibiotic version: Simplex PT (Tobramycin). |
