## Overview

Ceramics are biologic compounds made up of metallic and non-metallic elements.

## Types of Ceramics Used in Orthopaedics

-   **Bioinert**
    -   Alumina
    -   Zirconia
    -   Oxinium
-   **Bioactive**
    -   Hydroxyapatite (HA)
    -   Tricalcium Phosphate

### Specific Ceramics

-   **Alumina**:
    -   Main ceramic used, with improved quality compared to the 1st generation.
-   **Zirconia**:
    -   Currently not favored due to high fracture rates and expense.
-   **Oxinium**:
    -   Oxidized zirconia.
-   **Hydroxyapatite (HA)**:
    -   Bioactive and osteoconductive ceramic.
    -   Provides bidirectional bone growth.
    -   Speeds up the bonding process, aiding bone growth and bonding.

## Manufacturing

-   The strength of ceramics is dependent on the original grain size:
    -   Smaller grain size results in stronger ceramic.
-   Produced by pressing ceramic powder and water into a pre-fabricated cast.

### Modern Processes in 4th Generation Ceramic Production

1.  **Sintering via Hot Isostatic Pressing (Hipping)**:
    -   Binds individual grains more tightly.
    -   Increases density, toughness, and strength.
2.  **Platelet-like Crystals**:
    -   Addition of an oxide creates platelet-shaped crystals within the alumina matrix.
    -   These crystals help dissipate energy and deflect cracks.
3.  **Transformational Toughening**:
    -   Involves adding small amounts of zirconia to increase toughness and decrease fracture susceptibility.
    -   Used in the production of Biolox Delta (4th generation ceramic).

## Material Properties

### Good Properties

1.  **Inert**:
    -   Particles are not biologically active.
2.  **Stiff**:
    -   High modulus of elasticity.
3.  **Hard**:
    -   The 3rd hardest material known to man.
4.  **Smooth**:
    -   Low surface roughness, beneficial for articulating surfaces.
5.  **Good Scratch Profile**:
    -   Properties not significantly affected by scratches, which do not result in heaped edges.
6.  **Wettable**:
    -   Aids joint lubrication, allowing fluid film lubrication.
7.  **Low Wear Characteristics**:
    -   Less abrasive and linear wear; not subject to creep.
8.  **Less Osteolysis**:
    -   Small, less biologically active particles are virtually inert.
9.  **Lower Infection Rates**:
    -   Supported by Swedish registry data for Total Hip Replacements (THR).
    -   More wettable surfaces make it harder for bacteria to adhere.
10. **Very Strong in Compression**.

### Bad Properties

1.  **Brittle**:

    -   Virtually no plastic deformation before failure, leading to fracture risks and sharp debris particles.
    -   Less common with 4th generation ceramic (Biolox Delta), which reports a 0.04% fracture risk.

2.  **Weak in Tension**.

3.  **More Expensive**.

4.  **Lack of Long-term Data**.

5.  **Squeaking**:

    -   Etiology not fully understood; reported risk of 1-3%, though less than in the past.
    -   Component positioning, age, weight, and height are implicated.
    -   Likely caused by stripe wear due to edge loading during high flexion activities.

## Oxidised Zirconium (OXINIUM)

-   A metallic alloy of zirconium with a ceramic surface.
-   The alloy is oxidized in air, converting the surface into ceramic.
-   The ceramic is integrated into the material, not just a coating.

### Properties

-   Hard, smooth, scratch-resistant, inert, and wettable.
-   Suitable for individuals with metal allergies due to minimal nickel presence.
-   In vitro studies show greatly reduced polyethylene wear.
-   No long-term in vivo trials available yet, and it remains expensive.

## Ceramic Fracture

-   Generates numerous third bodies, causing accelerated wear of plastic and particulate debris.
-   Typically, ceramic particles are small and inert; however, third body wear produces larger, more biologically active debris, accelerating osteolysis.

### Revision Considerations

-   Revision should include synovectomy to clear all ceramic debris.
-   Damage to the Morse taper may necessitate revision to prevent catastrophic failure.
-   Incidence of complications is significantly lower with 4th generation ceramics and modern manufacturing techniques:
    -   Hot isostatic pressing.
    -   Transformational strengthening.
    -   Platelet-shaped crystal addition.
-   Current quoted risk of fracture stands at 0.04%.
