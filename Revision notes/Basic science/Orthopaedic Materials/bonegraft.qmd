### Indications

| **Category** | **Description** |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Structural support** | Bone loss, support of depressed joint surface, deformity (e.g., scaphoid) |
| **Aid bone formation** | Aid fusion of a joint or in the spine |
| **Non-union** | Stimulate fracture healing in atrophic non-union |

### Properties of Bone Grafts

-   **Osteogenic**: Graft contains living cells capable of differentiating into bone. Independent of the state of the graft bed (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow, or cancellous autograft).
-   **Osteoconductive**: Graft provides a scaffold for the ingrowth of capillaries and cells.
-   **Osteoinductive**: Graft provides biologic stimulus for host cells to differentiate to form bone (e.g., BMPs, TGF-beta). The graft material itself does not contain these cells.

### Classification

1.  **Autograft**
    -   Graft harvested from and implanted in the same individual.
    -   Contains viable host cells.
    -   Best graft option.
    -   Volume available is limited, leading to graft site morbidity.
2.  **Allograft**
    -   Graft taken from another individual of the same species.
    -   Allograft may be fresh, frozen, freeze-dried, or demineralized.
    -   Cells are destroyed in the process.
3.  **Xenograft**
    -   Graft obtained from a different species, often bovine or porcine.
4.  **Synthetic graft**

### Sources

-   **Cancellous bone**: Best option but volume available is limited.
-   **Cortical bone**
-   **Osteochondral grafts**
-   **Bone marrow**: Contains osteogenic and osteoinductive factors.

### Dangers

| **Graft Type** | **Risks** |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Autograft** | Graft site morbidity (scar, pain, infection, fracture) |
| **Allograft** | Infection transmission (2 in a million risk of Hepatitis C or HIV), increased infection risk, immune reaction, malignant cell implantation |

### Graft Incorporation

-   **Host bone grows into and replaces the graft.**
-   Allograft incorporates more slowly due to being less osteogenic and causing an immune response. Allograft may also be rejected.
-   Cancellous graft incorporates quicker than cortical graft due to a greater cell volume.

#### Cancellous Autograft Incorporation Process

1.  **Inflammatory response**
2.  **Creeping substitution**
    -   Graft stimulates osteoblast activity (osteoinduction).
    -   Osteoclastic resorption of the graft follows.
    -   The graft is eventually completely replaced by creeping substitution.
    -   X-rays at this stage appear denser, and bone is at its strongest.
3.  **Remodeling**
    -   Bone density reduces, as does strength over time, following Wolff's law.

-   Cancellous grafts achieve early structural strength as osteoblasts lay down bone onto the graft early on.

#### Cortical Graft Incorporation

1.  **Inflammatory response**
2.  **Osteoclast cutting cones**: All donor bone must be removed before appositional bone formation occurs. Mechanical strength is reduced by 50% during this process.
3.  **Osteoblasts**: With vessels, migrate into cutting cone channels and lay down lamellar bone.

-   There is no remodeling phase.
-   Mechanical strength takes 1-2 years to recover.
-   Incorporation is often incomplete.

#### Allograft Incorporation (Cortical or Cancellous)

-   Follows a similar process but is much slower.
-   Higher chance of rejection due to a pronounced immune response, which is cellular (not humoral) and mediated by host T cells.

#### Vascularized Graft Incorporation

-   Incorporates like a healing fracture since the biological and mechanical environment is similar.

### Bone Graft Substitutes

| **Type** | **Description** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Calcium Phosphates** | e.g., tricalcium phosphate, Norion (injectable). Undergoes partial conversion to hydroxyapatite. Degrades slowly, providing structural support (e.g., tibial plateau). Good osteoconductivity. |
| **Hydroxyapatite** | Does not incite any immune response. |
| **Other** | Various types of calcium sulfate (e.g., Osteoset), ceramic, silicone, and synthetic polymers. |

### Osteoinductive Agents

-   **TGF Beta**: Induces the formation of type 2 collagen.
-   **BMPs (Bone Morphogenic Proteins)**:
    -   20 types; only BMP-2 and BMP-7 approved for use in orthopedic surgery (in the USA).
    -   BMP-2 is the most osteogenic and primarily osteoinductive.
    -   OP-1 (BMP 7) proven effective in tibial non-union.
-   **PDGF**: Platelet-derived growth factor.
-   **FDGF**: Fibroblast-derived growth factor.

### Bone Banking

#### Principles

-   Written consent is required if the donor is living.
-   For cadavers, no objection from the next of kin is required.

#### Screening

-   Blood tests and history are used to highlight contraindications.

**Exclusions:** - HIV, Hepatitis, malignancy, chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases), steroid treatment, Alzheimer's, CJD, MS.

#### Available Products from Bone Banks

| **Type** | **Description** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Fresh Frozen Femoral Heads** | Available only to hospitals that collect them. |
| **Cancellous Cubes** | Freeze-dried in 1cm cubed size; purely osteoconductive with no viable cells. |
| **Cortical Struts** | From femoral shafts, ranging from 2-22 cm, freeze-dried or gamma-irradiated. |
| **Massive Allografts** | Proximal and distal femora and tibiae available; frozen and gamma-irradiated. |

### Allograft Processing Techniques

-   Physical debridement.
-   Ultrasonic and ethanol treatments.
-   Antibiotic soaks.
-   Irradiation (reduces mechanical strength).
-   Demineralization.

### Allograft Storage

| **Type** | **Details** |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Fresh** | Immunogenic, therefore not typically done. |
| **Fresh Frozen (-70Â°C)** | Preserves BMPs, little impact on mechanical strength, reduces immunogenicity. |
| **Freeze-Dried** | Safest regarding disease transmission and immune response, eliminates BMPs, reduces mechanical strength. |

### Other Methods of Augmenting Bone Healing

-   **Distant Corticotomy**: Within the same bone, it stimulates healing elsewhere in the bone.
-   **Electromagnetic effect**: Piezoelectric currents.
-   **Ultrasound**: Low-intensity ultrasound shown to affect gene expression, increase osteoblast activity, and stimulate blood flow.
