## Background

### 1960s
- **High complication rate with immediate surgery.**  
  - Due to outdated methods, poor trauma coordination, and limited ICU support.  
- **Delays in treatment for up to 2 weeks** with interim use of casts and traction.  
  - Resulted in:
    - Pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and soft tissue complications.
    - Stiff joints, prolonged rehabilitation, and extended ICU stays.

### 1980s
- **Early Total Care (ETC):**  
  - Shift to fixing everything as early as possible.  
  - **Adverse outcomes:**  
    - Prolonged surgical times, blood loss, hypothermia, and excessive "second hit" inflammatory response.

## Immune System Effects
- Trauma induces a **hyperinflammatory immune response.**  
  - Usually insignificant in isolated injuries.  
  - **Exacerbated by:**  
    - Hypothermia and blood loss in polytrauma patients.  
    - Can lead to:
      - Coagulopathy.
      - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
      - Renal failure.  

- **Surgical considerations:**  
  - Surgery adds to the inflammatory response.  
  - Stabilizing long bones and addressing chest/abdominal injuries help control the inflammatory cascade.  

### Research Studies:
1. **Morshed et al, JBJSam 2009:**  
   - Definitive femoral shaft fixation <12 hours post-injury led to **50% higher mortality** in polytrauma patients.  

2. **Pape et al, Ann Surgery 2007:**  
   - External Fixation (Ex Fix) followed by delayed definitive fixation reduced pulmonary complications in borderline patients.  

### Key Principle of DCO:
- **Stabilize injuries without causing an overwhelming "second hit" inflammatory response.**

## Patient Categories for DCO vs. ETC

### Four Patient Groups:
1. **Stable:** Suitable for ETC.  
2. **Borderline:** Suitable for DCO.  
3. **Unstable:** Suitable for DCO.  
4. **In Extremis:** Suitable for DCO.

## Criteria for Categorizing Patient Stability

### Key Parameters:
1. **Shock:**  
   - Blood pressure (BP), ATLS shock grades, transfusion requirements, lactate levels.  
2. **Temperature:**  
   - Degree of hypothermia.  
3. **Coagulation:**  
   - Platelet count, fibrinogen levels.  
4. **Systemic Injuries:**  
   - Lung function, chest, abdominal, pelvis, and external injuries (AIS).

## Markers of a Borderline Patient

1. **Mild Shock:**  
   - Grade 2–3 shock.  
   - **Blood transfusion:** 6–8 liters over the last 2 hours.  
   - **Lactate:** 2.5 mmol/L.  
   - **BP:** 80–100 mmHg.  

2. **Hypothermia:**  
   - Temperature < 35°C.  

3. **Coagulopathy:**  
   - Platelets < 110,000.  

4. **Other Injuries:**  
   - **Lung function:** FiO2 < 350 mmHg.  
   - Thoracic trauma (e.g., rib fractures).  
   - Mild pelvic and/or abdominal trauma.

## Orthopaedic Treatment Principles

1. **In Extremis Patients:**  
   - Orthopaedic injuries take lower priority.  
   - Treatment involves:  
     - Debridement.  
     - External fixation of long bones within 2 hours.  

2. **Borderline Patients:**  
   - Can consider intramedullary (IM) nailing if:  
     - Procedure is completed in <2 hours.  

3. **Patient Monitoring:**  
   - Monitor during and after each procedure.  
   - Proceed with the next procedure only if the patient remains stable.  
   - Temporize if instability arises.  

4. **Intra-Operative Markers of Instability:**  
   - FiO2 < 250 mmHg.  
   - Temperature < 32°C.  
   - Increasing fluid or blood requirement.
