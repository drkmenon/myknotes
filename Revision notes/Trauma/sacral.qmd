# Sacral Fractures and SI Joint Dislocations

## Epidemiology
- Considered pelvic ring injuries.  
- **Typical in:**  
  - Young males with high-energy mechanisms.  
  - Insufficiency fractures seen in the elderly.  

---

## Anatomy
- **Sacrum:** Comprises S1 to S5 bodies.  
  - Rarely, S1 can be lumbarised or L5 sacralised.  
  - Contains 4 foramina.  
- **Nerve Roots:**  
  - S1â€“S4 roots exit anteriorly through the foramina.  
  - S5 root exits below the sacrum.  
  - L5 root lies on the sacral ala, 2 cm medial to the SI joint.  
- **SI Joint:**  
  - Extends down to the level of the 3rd foramina.  
  - Inherently unstable due to poor bony congruity.  
- **Stability is provided by:**  
  - **Ligaments:**  
    - Anterior, interosseous, and posterior sacroiliac ligaments.  
      - Posterior sacroiliac ligament is the strongest and last to fail.  
    - Sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments.

## Classification and Fracture Patterns

### Denis Classification
Based on the fracture line's relation to the foramina:  

| **Type**  | **Features**            | **Notes**                          |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Zone 1    | Lateral to foramina      | 50% of all fractures, 5% neurologic injury. |
| Zone 2    | Through the foramina     | 30% incidence, 30% neurologic injury.        |
| Zone 3    | Medial to foramina       | 20% incidence, 60% neurologic injury.        |

- **Zone 1 and 2 fractures:**  
  - Tend to be vertical or oblique.  
  - Do not cause spinal instability but may result in pelvic instability.  
- **Zone 3 fractures:**  
  - May be vertical or horizontal.  
  - Horizontal fractures occur through the vestigial disc space due to hyperflexion.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - Any fracture may cause root or cauda equina injury.  
  - Spinal instability and spino-pelvic dissociation may occur with horizontal fractures.  
  - Pelvic instability may occur with vertical fractures.  
  - Comminuted or oblique fractures may result in instability of both spine and pelvis.  
  - Vertical shear injuries increase the likelihood of neurologic injury.  

### Crescent Fracture
- Iliac wing fracture that exits through the SI joint, possibly causing SI joint dislocation.  
- Typically an **LC2 injury**.

## Management Principles

### Non-Operative Management
- **Indicated for:**  
  - Stable pelvic ring.  
  - Congruent SI joint.  
  - No cauda equina syndrome.  
  - Impacted sacral fractures (often stable, especially in LC injuries).

### Goals of Surgery
1. Reduce the SI joint and pelvic ring.  
   - In anterior and posterior ring injuries, stabilize the posterior ring first.  
2. Decompress neural injuries.  
3. Prevent iatrogenic neural injury.  
4. Stabilize the spine if necessary.

## Methods of Stabilization

### Percutaneous Iliosacral Screws
- **Key Points:**  
  - Typically 1 or 2 screws.  
  - Requires clear imaging and an experienced surgeon.  
  - Joint must be reducible through closed techniques.  
  - Can be performed with the patient in prone or supine position.  
- **Main Risk:** Injury to the L5 nerve root.  

### ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation)
- **Preferred Technique:** Posterior plates to restore tension band.  
- **Additional Considerations:**  
  - May require anterior supplementation.  
  - Can be combined with iliosacral screws.  
  - Avoid over-compression of foramina when reducing fractures.  

### Lumbopelvic Fusion
- **Indication:** Spinal instability.  
- **Method:** Fuse into the lumbar spine using plates or pedicle screws and bars.
