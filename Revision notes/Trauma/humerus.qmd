## Anatomy

### Spiral Groove
- Radial nerve crosses humerus midpoint 14cm proximal to lateral epicondyle

### Lateral Intermuscular Septum
- 7-10 cm above lateral epicondyle

### Anterolateral Approach
- Best for proximal 2/3 fractures

### Posterior Approach
- Best for distal 1/2 humerus

## Non-Surgical Management
- Most common deformity is varus
- Acceptable deformity:
  - 30 degrees in coronal plane - varus is worse as it reduces shoulder abduction
  - 20 degrees in sagittal plane
  - cm shortening

### Treatment
- Coaptation splinting in a U slab for comfort
- Or collar and cuff initially
- Application of functional brace at 1 week
- Serial brace tightening to prevent slipping

### Results
- 2% (closed) and 6% (open) non-union rate - Sarmiento JBJSam 2000
- Mild deformity does not affect functional outcome
- Bracing worked as well for all types and location of fracture

## Operative Treatment

### Indications (All Relative)
- Even open fractures have been managed non-operatively

### Indications for Surgery
- Inability to maintain closed reduction within acceptable parameters, especially varus
- Open fracture
- Simple fracture patterns, especially transverse and short oblique
- Polytrauma
- Floating elbow

### Overall Results
- Surgery has a lower malunion and non-union rate

## Method of Fixation

### Ex Fix
- Indicated for polytrauma or gross contamination

### Safe Zones
- **Proximal 1/3**: 
  - Through the anterolateral fibers of deltoid â€“ avoid axial nerve and LHB
- **No safe zone in middle 1/3**
- **Distal 1/3**: 
  - Posterior, posteromedial, or posterolateral above olecranon fossa

### Plate
- Large fragment plate
- 8 cortices either side of fracture traditionally
- 6 cortices if good lag screw
- If bridge plating, consider working length rather than the absolute number of screws

### IM Nailing
- Problem: shoulder pain and cuff damage
- Risk of nerve and vascular injury during locking

### Plate vs. Nail
- Meta-analysis Mo Bandhari Acta Orthopedica 2010:
  - Complication rate with IM nailing is higher:
    - Shoulder pain
    - Re-operation
    - Delayed but not non-union

## Radial Nerve Palsy

- Systematic review of 4000 patients Gianoudis JBJSBr 2005:
  - 11% risk of radial nerve palsy
  - 24% for distal 1/3 fractures
  - Higher in spiral and transverse fractures
  - Spontaneous recovery in 70% at a mean of 7 weeks (longest 6 months)
  - EMG at 6 weeks if no recovery at all:
    - Look for fibrillations and sharp waves
    - Repeat at 3 months
    - If no activity at 3 months, refer to specialist unit
  - Exploration should not be delayed beyond 6 months in the presence of no activity

### Indications for Exploration
- Open penetrating or high energy injury with palsy (higher incidence of laceration)
- Nerve deficit after reduction and a Holstein-Lewis fracture is a soft indication (not proven beneficial in the literature)

## Non-Union

- Work up patient to identify cause:
  - Smoking
  - Infection
- Requires ORIF, bone grafting, and compression plating
- Compression plating alone suffices if it is a hypertrophic non-union
