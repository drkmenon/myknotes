## Incidence
- Rare but severe injury

## Mechanism
- High energy MVA 90%
- Traction injury of arm

## Pathoanatomy
- Scapulothoracic articulation is avulsed
- Clavicle fracture or ACJ disruption occurs
- Effectively a traumatic, internal forequarter amputation

## Associated Injuries
- 10% incidence of death
- 80% complete plexus injury
- 80% vascular injury
- 15% partial plexus injury
- Chest
- Spine
- May be no fractures

## Diagnosis
- Non-rotated AP XR shows increased distance from midline
- Associated clavicle fracture

## Management
- Reduction
- Angiography as standard
- Scapulothoracic fusion
- Primary amputation
- Decision making determined by:
  - Degree of plexus injury
  - Degree of vascular injury

## Outcome
- Poor
- Best determined by presence of complete plexus injury
