## Aims of Treatment
- **Primary Goal:** Prevention of AVN and arthritis through emergent, congruent reduction.

---

## Aetiology/Mechanism
- **Posterior Dislocations:** 9x more common than anterior dislocations.  
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Pure dislocations: Occur with more **flexion** and **adduction**.  
  - Fracture-dislocations: Occur with **lesser degrees of flexion**.  
- **Increased Femoral Anteversion:** Predisposes to fractures.  
- **Anterior Dislocations:**  
  - Caused by **hyperabduction** and **external rotation**.  
  - Types: Obturator, iliac, or pubic, depending on the position of the femoral head.  

---

## Associated Injuries
- Knee, pelvis, femoral neck, femoral head, and acetabular (posterior wall).

---

## Classification

### Direction of Dislocation
- **Posterior:** Most common.  
- **Anterior:** Subtypes include obturator, pubic, or iliac.

### Pipkin Classification
| Type  | Features                                           | AVN Rate |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **1** | Dislocation with fracture inferior to fovea (non-weight-bearing zone). | <5%      |
| **2** | Dislocation with fracture superior to fovea (weight-bearing zone).     | <5%      |
| **3** | Type 1 or 2 with associated femoral neck fracture. | 50%      |
| **4** | Type 1 or 2 with associated acetabular fracture.   | 10%      |

- **Management Notes:**  
  - Types 1 & 2: Non-operative if reduction is anatomical; lower threshold for surgery in Type 2.  
  - Type 3: **Worst prognosis**. Perform urgent ORIF in young patients; arthroplasty in older patients.  
  - Type 4: Management depends on acetabular fracture characteristics (position, size, stability).

## Management

### Examination
- Follow **ATLS protocol**.  
- Assess leg position to determine the direction of dislocation.  
- Evaluate **neurovascular status**.  
- Screen for associated injuries.

### Imaging
- **X-rays:** AP, Lateral, and Judet views.  
- **CT Scan:** Essential for identifying associated fractures.  

### Reduction
- **Advantages of ED Reduction:**  
  - Reduced time to reduction and immediate ability to proceed to CT if irreducible.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Requires adequate relaxation to avoid failed attempts and cartilage damage.  

#### Technique
- Apply **in-line traction**, exaggerate the deformity, and reverse the deformity.  
- For posterior dislocations: Flexion, traction, and internal rotation.  
- For anterior dislocations: Traction with external rotation.

#### Stability Testing
- Take AP, lateral, and Judet views to confirm congruency.  
- Test stability under loading conditions.

## Aims of Surgical Treatment
1. Achieve congruent reduction.  
2. Ensure stability of the reduction.  
3. Address associated fractures contributing to instability or incongruity.

### Associated Femoral Neck Fractures
- **Displaced:** ORIF and open reduction of the hip.  
- **Undisplaced:** Percutaneous pinning followed by closed reduction.

### Post-Reduction Steps
- Confirm true congruency with **fine-cut (2mm) CT scans**.  
- Remove loose bodies to prevent cartilage abrasion. This can be delayed.  
- Open reduction and fixation required for displaced femoral head fractures (e.g., Pipkin 2).  

---

## Open Reduction

### Indications
- Irreducible dislocations.  
- Fixation of head or neck fractures.  

#### Anterior Approaches
- Use **Smith-Peterson (SP)** or **Watson-Jones (WJ)** approach:  
  - **SP:** Preferred for head fractures or removing incarcerated fragments.  
  - **WJ:** Better for neck fractures.  

#### Posterior Approach (Kocher-Langenbach)
- Indicated for posterior dislocations and posterior wall acetabular fractures.  
- Protect the **sciatic nerve** by identifying it distally and keeping the hip extended with the knee flexed.

#### Trans-Trochanteric Approach (Ganz)
- Best for associated neck and head fractures.  
- Involves surgical dislocation of the hip while preserving the medial femoral circumflex artery.

## Outcomes and Complications

### Prognostic Factors
- **Time to Reduction:** Early reduction reduces AVN risk.  
- **Associated Fractures:** Increase complication rates.  
- **Repeated Reduction Attempts:** Can damage the blood supply.  
- **Open Reduction:** Risk of further violation and AVN.

### AVN and OA Rates
- **Simple Dislocations:** AVN < 5%.  
- **Pipkin Types:**  
  - Type 1 & 2: Comparable to simple dislocations if fractures are anatomically reduced.  
  - Type 4: AVN < 10%.  
  - Type 3: Worst prognosis, AVN up to 50%.  

### Post-Traumatic OA
- More common in Pipkin 2 fractures (involves weight-bearing zone).
