## Overview

-   **High-energy injury**.
-   **3 or more ligaments** involved is considered a **knee dislocation**.

## Pathoanatomy

-   Both **Cruciate ligaments** are almost always torn.
-   Up to **30% risk** of **popliteal artery injury**.
-   Up to **30% risk** of **peroneal nerve injury**.

## Associated Injuries

-   **Extensor Mechanism**.
-   **Fractures to knee**.
-   **Systemic high-energy injuries**.

## Examination

### Vascular Examination

-   **Critical**: Check pulses, Doppler, and **Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)**.
-   **ABPI**:
    -   \<0.9 is suspicious.
    -   \<0.8 is abnormal.
    -   **Note**: ABPI may be falsely high in chronic diabetics.
-   **Repeat vascular exams periodically**, as intimal tears can worsen over time, leading to false aneurysms.

### Neurologic Exam

-   **Common peroneal nerve** is the most commonly injured (up to 30%).

### Other Assessments

-   **Compartment Syndrome**.
-   **Extensor Mechanism**.
-   Assess for **ligament instability** (Lachman, Posterior Drawer, ER recurvatum, and Dial tests are useful acutely).

## Imaging

-   **X-rays**: Fractures and knee reduction.
-   **MRI**: Soft tissue injuries and joint status.
-   **Angiography**: If there is any hint of **vascular compromise** (potentially routine in severe cases).

## Classification of Knee Dislocations

-   **KD1**: Cruciates intact (rare without severe bony injury).
-   **KD2**: Cruciates torn, both collateral ligaments intact.
-   **KD3M**: Cruciates plus MCL torn.
-   **KD3L**: Cruciates plus LCL torn.
-   **KD4**: All 4 ligaments torn.
-   **KD5**: Fracture dislocation.
-   **Note**: Also describe as the direction of tibial translation (posterior is the most common).

## Management

### Non-Surgical

-   For **elderly**, **very sick**, or when the **leg is unviable**.

### Surgical

-   **Address limb-threatening problems first** (vascular/compartment syndrome).
-   **Timing**:
    -   Stabilize lateral or **PLC injuries** within 3 weeks.
-   **How much to do?**
    -   More **acute reconstruction** allows earlier **range of motion (ROM)** and prevents **fixed subluxation**, though it may cause **arthrofibrosis**.
    -   **Collateral repair** can be done first, with ACL and PCL addressed later.

### Ex-Fix Application

-   Provides **soft tissue rest** in an anatomical position.
    -   **Disadvantages**: Pin tracks may cause future issues, and stasis can lead to arthrofibrosis.
    -   **Preferred**: Early **ROM** and **weight-bearing** when possible.

# Injuries to the Medial Structures of the Knee

## Anatomy

### Superficial Medial Collateral Ligament (sMCL)

-   **Origin**: Adductor tubercle (just above the medial epicondyle of femur).
-   **Insertions**:
    -   Semimembranosus rim.
    -   Tibia.
-   **Primary restraint** to **valgus** force.

### Deep Medial Collateral Ligament (dMCL)

-   Deep to the superficial ligament, continuous with the medial joint capsule.
-   Has 2 parts:
    -   **Meniscofemoral**.
    -   **Meniscotibial**.
-   **Secondary restraint** to valgus and especially **external rotation**.

### Posterior Oblique Ligament (POL)

-   Fibrous extension of the **semimembranosus tendon**.
-   Blends with and reinforces the **posteromedial joint capsule**.
-   Restrains against **valgus** and **internal rotation**.

## Injury Classification

-   **Clinical Diagnosis** relies on the patient's ability to tolerate examination.
    -   Otherwise, **laxity** may be underestimated.

### Classification

-   **Grade 1**: Pain but no laxity at 20-30 degrees flexion.
-   **Grade 2**: Pain and mild laxity (MRI reveals partial tear of POL and sMCL).
-   **Grade 3**: Complete disruption of all structures with significant laxity.

### Healing

-   **sMCL** has a rich blood supply and heals well.
-   Ligament strength improves with movement and loading.
-   **Full immobilization** during rehab is detrimental.

## Clinical Diagnosis

### History

-   **Valgus force injury**.
-   Difficulty with sports requiring turning and cutting movements.
-   **Pain** around the medial aspect of the knee.

### Examination

-   **Tenderness** over medial structures.
-   **Bruising/swelling**.
-   **Laxity testing** in extension and 30 degrees flexion:
    -   Stable in extension but not in flexion = **POL intact**.
-   **End point presence**: With complete tear, ACL is the only remaining valgus restraint.
-   **Anteromedial draw test**: Externally rotate the tibia while performing an anterior draw.
    -   External rotation increases with complete MCL tears.

### Radiographic Evaluation

-   **X-rays**: Avulsion fractures, comparative stress radiographs to demonstrate laxity.
-   **MRI**: Quantify if the deep part of the MCL is torn and assess for other injuries.
    -   **Bone bruising** on the lateral tibial plateau can be noted.

## Management

### Non-Operative Treatment

-   Generally, **grade 1 and 2 tears** can be managed non-operatively with **good results**.
-   **sMCL** heals well due to its blood supply.
-   All **grade 1 and 2 injuries** should be treated non-operatively.

### Grade 3 Injuries

-   Initially treated **non-operatively**.
-   May require **repair** if persistent instability is present.

### Non-Operative Treatment Protocol

-   **Functional rehab program** with early **weight-bearing** and **ROM**.
-   **Knee brace** for protection against valgus and **external rotation**.

### Operative Treatment

-   Goal: Restore anatomy of the superficial ligament, especially its two tibial attachments.
-   Options:
    -   **Direct repair** with or without augmentation.
    -   **Reconstruction** with **autograft** or **allograft**.
    -   **sMCL advancement** to tighten medial structures.
    -   **Pes Anserinus transfer**.

## Pellegrini-Stieda Syndrome

-   **Definition**: Intraligamentous calcification resulting from a **chronic MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament) tear**, typically on the **femoral side**.

-   **Symptoms**:

    -   May be **painful** due to the calcification or associated inflammation.
    -   The **heterotopic bone** (abnormal bone formation) can sometimes contribute to discomfort.

-   **Management**:

    -   **Avoid operative treatment** if possible.
    -   If necessary, surgical **excision of the calcified tissue** may be considered in persistent or debilitating cases.
