## Anatomy
- **Origin**: Lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle (MFC).
- **Insertion**: A sulcus on the posterior tibia, 15mm below the joint line.
- **Menisco-femoral Ligaments**:
  - **Humphrey’s ligament**: Anterior to the PCL.
  - **Wrisberg’s ligament**: Posterior to the PCL.

### Blood Supply
- Middle geniculate artery.
- **Better vascularity than ACL**, leading to better healing of PCL.

### Innervation
- Posterior articular nerve (tibial nerve).

## Biomechanics
- **Main restraint**: Posterior tibial translation.
- **Secondary stabilizer**: Varus-valgus stability.

## Mechanism of Injury
- **Direct anterior to posterior blow to tibia** with knee flexed (e.g., dashboard injury).
- **Hyperextension or hyperflexion injury**.
- **Fall with foot plantarflexed and knee flexed** (posterior force on tibia).

## Classification
- **Isolated or part of a multi-ligament injury**:
  - Completely different management strategies.
  
### Clinical Classification (based on sag degree):
- **Grade 1**: Tibia still in front of femoral condyles.
- **Grade 2**: Tibia level with femoral condyles.
- **Grade 3**: Tibia sagged behind femoral condyles.

### Injury Location
- Mid-substance.
- Avulsion from tibial insertion.

## Concurrent Injuries
- Often associated with **patellofemoral chondral injuries**.
- Other ligament injuries must be ruled out.

## History
- Mechanism as described above.
- **Instability**: Especially noticeable when ascending or descending stairs or hills.

## Examination
- **Posterior Drawer Test**: Positive in grade 3 PCL injuries and multi-ligament injuries.
- **Dial Test**:
  - Increased external rotation (ER) of the tibia with the knee flexed to 30 and 90 degrees.
  - 30 degrees indicates **PLC** (posterolateral corner) involvement alone.
  - 30 and 90 degrees together indicate **PLC and PCL** involvement.

## Management
**Goal**: Prevent symptomatic instability.

### Non-operative Management
- For the majority of **grade 1 and 2 isolated PCL injuries**.
- Even most **grade 3 injuries** are treated non-operatively.
- **Bony avulsions** usually heal well.
- **Rest in extension splint** for 4 weeks with limited ROM.
- **Rehabilitation**:
  - Closed-chain rehab focusing on quads to pull tibia anteriorly.
  - Graded return to sports.

### Operative Management
- **Grade 3 injuries** may require reconstruction, even if isolated.
- **Combined ligament injuries** require stabilisation.
- Symptomatic patients are candidates for surgery.

### Operative Options
- **Single or double bundle**:
  - PCL has **anterior-lateral (AL)** and **posterior-medial (PM)** bundles.
  - No proven benefit of the double bundle technique over single bundle.
  
- **Tibial Onlay or Trans-Tibial Inlay Technique**:
  - **Tibial onlay** may avoid the ‘killer angle’, where a transtibial graft turns acutely towards the femoral tunnel.
  - **Trans-tibial inlay** requires a long graft.

### Graft Selection
- **Hamstrings** may not be long enough for transtibial technique.
- **Synthetic or allografts** are commonly used (e.g., LARS – Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System).
  
- **Other options**:
  - **BPTB (Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone)**: Tibial onlay as bone block required.
  - **Quadriceps Tendon**.
