## Anatomy
- **Anteromedial and Posterolateral bundles**  
  - Named by their insertion on the tibia.

### AM Bundle
- Single bundle reconstruction traditionally based on the AM bundle.
- Origin: Proximal and posterior on the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC).
- Insertion: Anterior to the posterior medial (PM) bundle.
- Tight in flexion.

### PL Bundle
- Origin: Distal to the AM bundle.
- Insertion: Posterior to the AM bundle.
- Tight in extension.

**Remember AMPLE**  
- **Anteromedial tight in flexion, Posterolateral tight in extension**.

## Blood Supply
- Middle geniculate artery branches and fat pad vessels.

## Nerve Innervation
- Posterior articular nerve (tibial nerve).
- Ligament also has mechanoreceptors on its surface, providing inherent proprioception.

## Biomechanics
- Primary restraint to anterior tibial translation.
- PM bundle prevents hyperextension.
- Least tension on ACL at 30-40 degrees flexion (good position for examination – Lachman’s test).
- Secondary restraint to:
  - Varus & Valgus.
  - Internal rotation in particular.
- Mechanoreceptors provide proprioceptive role.

## Mechanism of Injury
- Typically a non-contact jumping, twisting, or deceleration injury.

## History
- Typical history and haemarthrosis have a sensitivity of 70% for ACL tear.

## Examination
- Immediate haemarthrosis.
- Lachman test has 95% sensitivity and specificity.
- Pivot shift test is similar but requires a relaxed patient.

## Investigation
- MRI.

## Concurrent Injuries
- **Meniscal Injuries**:
  - Acutely, lateral meniscus is most common.
  - In ACL-deficient knee, medial meniscus (MM) is more common due to anchoring to the plateau.
- **Kissing Lesion**:
  - Anterior LFC and posterior-lateral lateral plateau.
- **Osteochondral Damage**.
- **Classic Terrible Triad**: ACL, MCL, and MM (O'Donoghue).
  - Actually, ACL & LM is more common.

## Predisposing Factors
- High-risk sports.
- Reduced notch width.
- ACL rupture is 4x more common in women – multifactorial:
  - Women have narrower notches.
  - Hyperlaxity; hormonal factors.
  - Lower limb mechanical differences in alignment.

## Natural History
- **Sport in ACL deficiency** causes further chondral & meniscal damage, likely leading to accelerated arthritis.
- Not proven that ACL reconstruction alters the natural history of arthrosis.
  - At the time of rupture, release of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors begins the degenerative process.

## Management
**Goals of Treatment**:
1. Provide a stable asymptomatic knee.
2. Facilitate return to sports.
3. Prevent accelerated arthritis and other knee injuries.

- Goal 1 is essential, Goal 2 is possible, Goal 3 is questionable.
- Treatment should be individualized.

### Non-operative
- Good option if the patient is willing to make lifestyle changes.
- If the patient is low demand to begin with.
- Patient over 40 years should be considered carefully.
- If significant degenerative changes in the knee exist.
- Aggressive physiotherapy focusing on quads, hamstrings, and proprioception.
- Modified sports.
- Knee brace use is not proven to be beneficial.

### Primary Repair
- Not an option, and it has failed in the past.
- ACL becomes coated in myofibroblasts, which prevent healing.

### ACL Reconstruction Timing
- Generally, wait until full range of motion (ROM) is achieved, especially extension, to minimize the risk of arthrofibrosis.
- Some proponents perform immediate reconstruction for elite athletes, requiring extensive supervised physiotherapy and very motivated patients.

## Graft Selection
- **Autograft**, **Allograft**, or **Synthetic**.

### Autograft
- **Advantages**: Low morbidity, low immune reaction, cost-effective.
- Revascularization and incorporation of the graft are advantages.
- **Autograft strength** initially deteriorates; thus, the chosen graft must be stronger than the native ACL:
  - Quad Hamstring: 4500 N.
  - BPTB: 2500 N.
  - Native ACL: 2000-2500 N.
  
- **BPTB Graft**:
  - Bony fixation with slightly lower re-rupture rate.
  - May cause patellofemoral osteoarthritis and anterior knee pain.
  
- **Hamstrings**:
  - Single strand hamstrings alone are weaker than ACL.
  - Hamstrings folded to give a 4-strand graft have double the tensile strength of native ACL.
  - Slight 10% reduction in hamstring strength, but not clinically noticeable.
  
- **BPTB in elite sprinters** is recommended as hamstrings are vital.

- **Failure rates**: Comparable between hamstrings and BPTB.

### Allograft
- Options: Achilles, BPTB, quads tendon.
- **Advantages**: Faster immediate recovery (no graft site morbidity), no strength reduction initially, better cosmesis.
- **Disadvantages**: More expensive, infection and immune risk.
  
- **Freeze-dried allograft** has similar properties to autograft.
- **Irradiated allograft** loses its mechanical properties (no longer used).

### Single or Double Bundle
- Double bundle is more anatomic but has no proven clinical benefit.
- Double bundle is technically more demanding.

## Rehabilitation
- Avoid braces if possible.
- Focus on closed chain quads and hamstrings exercises.
- Gradually build up exercises and return to full sports at 9 months.
- Hamstrings are important for limiting anterior translation.
- Proprioceptive training.

## Surgical Principles

### Tunnel Placement
- Position of the femoral tunnel is more important.
- Influenced by tibial tunnel position if using a trans-tibial technique.
- Anterior placement of the tibial tunnel should be avoided.
- Angle of the femoral tunnel should be 60 degrees to the joint line, aiming for the 10:30 or 1:30 clock position.
  - This avoids a vertical and anterior graft.
  - Anterior graft placement leads to impingement on PCL and pain, limiting range of motion in extension.
  
- **Notchplasty** may be performed to visualize the wall of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and clear the resident’s ridge.

- **Tibial Tunnel**: Lateral edge should be aligned with the lateral tibial spine, starting just anterior to the MCL insertion.

### Graft Fixation
- Options: Interference screw, cortical or cross pins.
  - Interference screws are easy but may widen tunnels and be proud.
  - Cortical screws (e.g., endobuttons) provide excellent results.
  - Cross pins are advantageous as they secure the graft closer to the joint, preventing windscreen-wiping.

## Complications
- Main technical issue is anterior tunnel placement, leading to impingement, pain, tightness, and decreased flexion.
- Cyclops lesion (scar tissue from remnant ACL).
- Graft impingement in the notch.
- **Arthrofibrosis** and global stiffness occur if surgery is done too early before achieving full ROM.
- Re-rupture rate: 2-5%.
- Infection and thromboembolism: <1%.
- **Anterior knee pain** is more common with BPTB.

## Results of ACL Reconstruction
- Re-rupture rate: 2-5%.
- 80-90% have <3mm laxity on KT-1000.
- 80-90% return to sport with good to excellent results.

## Revision ACL Reconstruction

### Principles
- The most important determinant of a good result is understanding the cause of failure.
- Graft selection: more often use allografts to avoid other leg graft morbidity and provide more graft length.
- Revision is often done in two stages.
- Bone grafting may be needed to restore bone stock if tunnels are widened.

### Results
- Revision ACL reconstruction has less favorable outcomes than primary ACL reconstruction.
