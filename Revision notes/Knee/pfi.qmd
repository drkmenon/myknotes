### Definition
- Symptomatic dislocation or subluxation of the patella, usually laterally.

### Epidemiology
- Can be **congenital or acquired** (usually with mechanical or anatomical predisposition).
- **Women > Men** (due to laxity).
- **Recurrence**:
  - 20% risk after first dislocation.
  - 50% risk after second dislocation.
  - Younger age at first dislocation increases long-term risk.

### Anatomy
- **Patella**: Has the thickest cartilage in the body.
  - Facets: Lateral, medial, and odd (lateral facet is typically larger).
  - **Types** (Wrisberg classification):
    1. Type 1: Central ridge, equal size of medial and lateral facets.
    2. Type 2: Medialized ridge, small medial facet (common).
    3. Type 3: Nearly absent medial facet or ridge.
- **Trochlea**: V-shaped, with a higher lateral wall (bony buttress), may be dysplastic (classified by Dejour).

### Soft Tissue Restraints
- **Medial**:
  - MPFL (Medial Patellofemoral Ligament): 50% of the medial pull (primary static restraint).
  - VMO (Vastus Medialis Obliquus): Primary dynamic restraint.
  - Patellomeniscal ligament, medial retinaculum.
- **Lateral**:
  - ITB (Iliotibial Band), Vastus Lateralis, LPFL (Lateral Patellofemoral Ligament).

### Biomechanics
- **Joint Reaction Forces**:
  - Level walking: 2x body weight.
  - Stairs: 4x body weight.
  - Squatting: 8x body weight.
  - Jumping: 20x body weight.
- **Q Angle**:
  - Angle between ASIS, the center of the patella, and tibial tuberosity.
  - Indicates the lateral force vector on the patella.
  - Decreased Q angle stabilizes the patella by reducing quadriceps pull in flexion.
  - Alternative to Q angle: **Trochlea Groove to Tibial Tuberosity** (via MRI/CT).

### Anatomical Causes of Instability
1. High Q angle (lateralized or externally rotated tuberosity, lateralized ASIS).
2. Trochlea dysplasia.
3. Anteverted femoral neck.
4. External tibial torsion.
5. Genu valgum.
6. Soft tissue laxity/incompetence.
7. Hyper-pronated feet.

### Clinical Assessment
- **History**:
  - Dislocation or subluxation?
  - Associated pain and its location.
  - Global laxity, trauma history, family history.
  - Age of onset and functional impact.
- **Examination of Patellofemoral Joint**:
  - **Look**: Coronal alignment, Q angle, foot pronation, scars, quads bulk, swelling, Beighton score.
  - **Gait**: Foot progression angle, patella orientation.
  - **Sit**: Extensor mechanism competence, crepitus, J sign, patella tracking, patella alta.
  - **Lie Down**: Effusion, Clarke's test, patella excursion and apprehension test, patella tilt, screen knee ROM.
  - **Prone**: Thigh-foot axis, tibial and femoral versions, Gage's test for anteversion.
  - **Finishing**: Knee ligaments, Beighton score, hip and foot examination, pulses & neurology, weight-bearing plain X-rays, patella merchant view.

### Imaging
- **Plain X-ray**:
  - AP, lateral, and merchant views (knee semi-flexed to engage patella).
  - May show tilt, genu valgum, patella alta/baja.
- **CT**:
  - Most useful modality for assessing patella height, tilt, and trochlea groove.
  - Protocol: Mid-axial cuts in 10째 increments (0-60째).
  - **Measurements**:
    - Patella height.
    - Patella tilt (<7째 = tilt, >11째 = normal).
    - Trochlea Groove-Tibial Tuberosity Offset (<10mm = normal, >20mm = abnormal).
- **MRI**:
  - Used for soft tissue evaluation if considering soft tissue reconstruction.
  - Often used as an alternative to CT scans.

### Management

#### Acute Dislocations
- **Non-operative**: In almost all cases, non-operative management is effective.
  - Indications for surgery: Osteochondral injury, irreducible lateral subluxation.

#### Chronic Instability
- **Recurrent symptomatic instability** with imaging evidence of the cause.

#### Non-Operative Treatment
1. Extension splint for 2-4 weeks, followed by physiotherapy.
2. **VMO strengthening program**.
3. McConnell taping.

#### Operative Options

- **Proximal Realignment**:
  - MPFL repair/reconstruction (+/- VMO advancement/re-attachment).
  - **Indications**: No mechanical/anatomical abnormality, evidence of tilt/maltracking.

- **Lateral Release**:
  - Can be combined with other procedures but controversial when done alone.
  - Only if lateral structures are truly tight with isolated tilt and no mechanical abnormality (rare).
  - **Avoid in case of arthrosis**.

- **Distal Realignment**:
  1. **Elsie Tremellat**:
     - Medial and internal rotation tibial tubercle realignment.
     - Must have proven lateralization of tibial tuberosity.
     - Consider distal unloading procedure if arthrosis present.
  2. **Fulkerson**:
     - Medial and anterior realignment.
     - Reduces patellofemoral joint reaction forces by unloading the joint.
  3. **Tibial Tubercle Distalization**:
     - For patella alta (late engagement of patella).
  4. **Trochleoplasty**:
     - If dysplastic trochlea needs addressing.
  5. **Address Other Underlying Deformities**:
     - E.g., tibial torsion, if symptoms are severe.
