### Not the Same as Osteochondral Defects (OCD)
- **Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)** may cause an osteochondral defect but is not the same.

### Aetiology (Causes)
The causes are **unknown**, but three suggested theories are:
1. **Hereditary**:
   - Associations: Perthes disease, dwarfism, Stickler's disease, tibia vara.
2. **Vascular**:
   - Paucity of blood supply just adjacent to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) on the medial femoral condyle (MFC).
3. **Traumatic**:
   - Repetitive microtrauma from shear forces.

### Clinical Presentation
- **Mechanical symptoms**:
  - Pain
  - Activity-related swelling
  - Catching
  - Locking

### Imaging
1. **X-ray**:
   - Standing AP/Lateral and Skyline views.
   - Notch view (knee flexed 30 degrees) shows posterior condyles better.
   - Malalignment may be contributory, especially in adults.
   
2. **MRI**:
   - Gold standard for assessment.
   - Identifies or eliminates concurrent pathology.
   - Can assess stability, fragmentation, and lesion size.

### Classification
1. **By Age of Onset**:
   - **Juvenile**: Open physis.
   - **Adult**: Closed physis.

2. **By Location**:
   - Typically on the lateral aspect of the **medial femoral condyle (MFC)**.
   - May occur anywhere, but lateral condyle lesions are least common.
   - Lateral condyle lesions, if present, are associated with **discoid meniscus** or **meniscectomy**.

3. **Cahill Classification**:
   - Classifies lesions by lateral position in relation to Blumensaatâ€™s line.

4. **By Stability**:
   - **Type 1**: Subchondral bone compression.
   - **Type 2**: Partially detached lesion.
   - **Type 3**: Fully detached lesion but still within the underlying crater.
   - **Type 4**: Loose body.

### Prognostic Factors
Lesions with poorer outcomes include:
- **Closed physis** (older children).
- **Atypical location**.
- **Large size** (>2 cm).
- **Unstable fragment**.
- **Subchondral sclerosis on X-ray** (poor response to drilling).

### Management
1. **Non-Surgical**:
   - Goal: Allow healing and prevent displacement of fragment.
   - Includes:
     - Activity modification
     - Analgesia (avoid NSAIDs)
     - ROM (Range of Motion) program
     - Restricted weight-bearing

2. **Surgical**:
   - Goals: Stabilize fragments, restore articular congruity.
   - Treatment may be **arthroscopic** or **open**, with the same principles.
   
   **If Fragments Are Preservable**:
   - **Antegrade transchondral microfracture**: If the chondral surface is intact, it promotes healing underneath.
   - **Fixation of fragments + microfracture/compression grafting**: Used if the lesion is reparable; bioabsorbable pins are commonly used.
     - This is the treatment of choice for most cases.

   **If Fragments Are Not Preservable**:
   - **Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI)**.
   - **Autologous chondral plug transplantation**.
   - **Allograft transplantation**.
   - **Mosaicplasty**.
   - **Microfracture**.
   
   **If Malalignment in Adults**:
   - **Osteotomy** +/- any of the above treatments.
   - **Hemiepiphysiodesis** to correct alignment if the physis is still open and limb malaligned.
