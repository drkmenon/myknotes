## Anatomy

### MCL
- **Superficial Layer**:
  - Fan-shaped.
  - One origin and two insertion points.
  - More important for **valgus stability**.
  
- **Deep Layer**:
  - Thickening of the medial capsule.
  - Connected to the medial meniscus (MM) by coronary ligaments.
  - **Origin**: Medial epicondyle of femur (adductor tubercle).
  - **Insertion**: Anteromedial tibia, deep to the pes anserinus tendons.

### Blood Supply
- Superomedial and inferomedial geniculate arteries.

## Medial Complex
- Composed of **3 layers** of static and dynamic stabilizers.

### Static Stabilizers:
- **Superficial MCL** (primary restraint to valgus).
- **Posterior Oblique Ligament**.
- **Deep MCL**.

### Dynamic Stabilizers:
- **Semimembranosus** (5 insertion points).
- **Pes Anserinus Tendons** (Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendinosus).
- **Medial Retinaculum, VMO**.

### Layered Structure:
| Layer  | Contents                                                   |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Layer 1 | Patella Retinacular fascia, Sartorius & Sartorius Fascia, Semitendinosus, Gracilis |
| Layer 2 | Superficial Medial Collateral, POL                        |
| Layer 3 | Semimembranosus (5 insertions), Medial Capsule, Deep MCL   |

## Pes Anserinus
- Overlies the MCL.
- **Pneumonic SGT FOT** (Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendinosus).
  - **Sartorius** (femoral nerve).
  - **Gracilis** (obturator nerve).
  - **Semitendinosus** (tibial branch of the sciatic nerve).

## Biomechanics
- **MCL** is the primary restraint to **valgus**.
- Other ligaments and structures act as **secondary static or dynamic** stabilizers.

## Injury Mechanism
- MCL is the **most commonly injured knee ligament**.
- **Valgus force**.
- Injury is usually to **femoral origin**.

## Concurrent Injuries
- **ACL** is the most common concurrent injury.
- Found in **75% of grade 3 MCL injuries**.

## Examination
- **Valgus instability** in 30Â° flexion indicates **isolated MCL**.
- **Valgus instability in extension** indicates **grade 3 MCL** with possible other ligament injury (e.g., ACL).
- **Pivot Shift Test**: 
  - Used to rule out **ACL**.
  - False negative in **grade 3 MCL**.
  - Based on joint pivoting and subluxation around an intact MCL.

## Classification
- Based on degree of **valgus laxity**:
  - **Grade 1**: Sprain with no laxity.
  - **Grade 2**: Partial injury with laxity but with end point.
  - **Grade 3**: Complete injury with >10mm joint opening.
  
- **Grade 3 isolated MCL** is **rare**.
- **Chronic MCL**: Seen on X-ray as **Pelligrini-Steida sign** (ossification at MCL femoral origin).

## Management

### Non-operative Management
- Almost all MCL injuries are managed non-operatively.
- **Brace** for grade 2 and 3 injuries.
- **RICE** (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation).
- **ROM** and early **weight-bearing**.
- **Graded return to sports**.

### Operative Management
- **Failed non-operative management**.
- **Chronic symptomatic MCL instability**.
- **Acute MCL injuries** with ligament flipped into the joint.
- **Multi-ligament instability**: MCL can sometimes be left alone.

## Surgical Technique

### Acute Injury:
- **Proximal avulsion**: Use anchors in the **medial epicondyle**.
- **Direct repair** for intrasubstance tears.
- May need to **advance MCL and POL** if tissue is insufficient.

### Chronic Injury:
- More common scenario.
- **Advancement** may not be possible.
- **Reconstruct** using **ST autograft** or **allografts** at isometric points through tunnels.

## Management of Combined ACL and MCL Injury
- **Rule**: Wait for MCL healing (6-8 weeks) before addressing ACL reconstruction.
