### Clinical Indications
- **Varus malalignment** with:
  1. Medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) and pain
  2. Instability
     - Alteration of the slope can compensate for anterior or posterior translation in ACL or PCL deficient knee
  3. Protection of chondral or meniscal surgery
     - Restoration of mechanical axis maintains longevity of the soft tissue procedure

### Contraindications
1. **Absolute**:
   - Patellofemoral OA
   - Tricompartmental OA
   - Fixed flexion contracture >10 degrees
   - Fixed varus or valgus contracture >10 degrees
   - Lateral tibial subluxation >1cm

2. **Relative**:
   - Poor range of motion (ROM) (<90 degrees flexion)
   - Smoker
   - Inflammatory arthropathy
   - Varus thrust on walking

### Ideal Patient
1. Young
2. Non-smoker
3. Correctible deformity
4. Isolated medial OA

### Surgical Techniques

#### Traditionally Closing Lateral Wedge
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. Patella baja
  2. Altered slope
  3. More challenging total knee replacement (TKR)
  4. Peroneal nerve palsy
  5. Loss of bone stock

#### Medial Opening Wedge
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. Non-union
  2. Risk of collapse or fixation loss
- **Advantages**:
  1. Retention of slope and bone stock
  2. Easier TKR
  3. No patella baja
- **Outcome**:
  - No high-quality trials indicate superiority of one technique over the other.

### Alternative Techniques

#### Dome Osteotomy
- **Description**: Done above the tibial tubercle.
- **Indication**: Useful for big, multiplanar correction.
- **Advantages**: Does not alter patella height.
- **Disadvantages**: Technically difficult.

#### Distraction Osteogenesis Technique
- **Indication**: For very large corrections using the Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF) for gradual distraction.

### Pre-Operative Planning
#### History
- Determine if pain is acute or insidious.
- Rule out meniscal tear vs arthrosis.
- Assess symptoms like instability, locking, or catching.
- Consider smoking history.

#### Examination
- Overall alignment.
- Check for concurrent patella instability and consider tubercle transfer if necessary.
- Assess knee stability.
- Identify the point of pain.

#### Investigations
1. Simple AP, lateral, and skyline X-rays of the knee standing.
2. Long leg standing alignment X-rays.
3. MRI.
4. Arthroscopic evaluation pre-operatively.

### Osteotomy Planning
1. **Long leg AP views** are essential for planning.
2. **Mark the mechanical axis** of the leg â€“ from the center of the femoral head to the center of the ankle.
   - The axis should pass just lateral to the middle of the tibial plateau.
   - If the line passes more medially, the knee is in varus; if more laterally, the knee is in valgus.
3. **Osteotomy Angle**:
   - Aim for slight overcorrection to valgus.
   - Calculate the angle between the two lines (femoral head to the desired axis and ankle to the same point) for correction.

4. **Opening Wedge Height**:
   - Draw a line from 4cm distal to the medial joint line to just proximal to the fibula head (this is the osteotomy cut plane).
   - Measure the distance from the subtended line to the femoral mechanical axis line to determine how much the osteotomy needs to be opened for angular correction.

### Post-Operative Management
- ROM exercises.
- **Touch-weight bearing (TWB)** for 6 weeks (6/52).

### Outcomes
- **Conversion to TKR vs Primary TKR**:
  - High tibial osteotomy may have longer surgical time, less mean ROM, and is technically more demanding, but clinical outcomes do not correlate with these factors.
  
- **Closing vs Opening Wedge**:
  - No long-term outcome difference between closing and opening wedge techniques, though theoretical benefits of the opening wedge are widely accepted today.

- **Overall**:
  - High tibial osteotomy provides good long-term results, with a mean follow-up of 10 years in some studies, maintaining activity levels and pain relief.
