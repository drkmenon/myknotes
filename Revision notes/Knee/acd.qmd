### Why treat these lesions?
- Result in pain
- Future arthritis

## Non-Operative Modalities
- Activity modification, analgesia, physiotherapy
- Not going to affect development of arthritis

## Operative Options
- **Debridement of lesion and trimming of chondral flaps**
- **Bone Marrow Stimulation (Micro-fracture)**
- **Osteochondral Grafting**:
  - Autograft (Mosaicoplasty)
  - Allograft
- **Chondrocyte Implantation**:
  - ACI
  - MACI
- **Osteotomy/Arthroplasty**

### Factors Affecting Treatment Outcome
- **Worse outcomes if**:
  - Age >40 years
  - Multiple lesions
  - Multi-compartment disease
  - Limb deformity
  - Inflammatory disease

### Debridement of Lesion and Trimming of Chondral Flaps
- Some studies show significant improvement in many patients; however, these improvements have not been sustained over time as it does not address the underlying problem.

### Bone Marrow Stimulation (Micro-fracture)
- Perforation of the subchondral plate to recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow into the lesion.
- Forms fibrocartilage, which is second-best to hyaline cartilage (contains less type 2 collagen).
- **Key Technical Points**:
  - Form a stable confined clot within the lesion.
  - Create a stable cartilage shoulder around the lesion.
  - Remove the calcified base of the lesion with a curette.
  - Perforate the subchondral bone until fat droplets are seen.
  - Use CPM; restrict WB and ROM depending on location of lesion.
- **Advantages**: Cheap, easy, single surgery, short recovery.
- **Disadvantages**: Not hyaline cartilage; less useful >40 years due to lower marrow concentration of stem cells.
- **Outcomes**: 
  - Good results in many papers. RCTs show it to be better than ACI, although others have shown the opposite.
  - Results may deteriorate over time.
  - Remains a safe, easy first-line option with reasonable results, good to excellent results in around 2/3 of patients.

### Osteochondral Grafting - Autograft (Mosaicoplasty)
- Use of multiple osteochondral plugs harvested from non-articular parts of the same knee to fill the defect. Produces a congruent, viable, and durable option.
- **Key Technical Points**:
  - Pack cylinders closely to avoid large gaps.
  - Use cylinders of the same depth as the holes to prevent loosening/subsidence.
  - Create a congruent surface.
- **Advantages**: Autologous, hyaline cartilage, single operation, low recovery time.
- **Disadvantages**: Technical challenge, graft site morbidity, limited volume available.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Good: 80% good or excellent at 36 months.
  - Two RCTs show better improvement than ACI, although all improved, and even some with debridement alone improved.

### Osteochondral Grafting - Allograft
- Use of fresh (frozen denatured chondrocytes) allograft to fill defects.
- The graft is harvested fresh and stored in Hartmans or culture fluid in the fridge (4 degrees). The allograft bone is necrotic and is replaced by creeping substitution, providing a scaffold for cartilage incorporation. 
- The cartilage itself, being fairly avascular, resists immune reactions.
- **Advantages**: No graft site morbidity, very good for large lesions, excellent congruency, hyaline cartilage.
- **Disadvantages**: Poor availability of allograft, expensive, technically demanding, immune/infection risk.
- **Outcomes**: Long-term graft survival has been shown with good results in case series, but no good evidence that this is better than other modalities.
  - Other types of allograft, such as fresh frozen and cryopreserved, are inferior in quality due to the denaturing of the chondrocytes and are not recommended.

### Chondrocyte Implantation - Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI)
- Harvesting of host chondrocytes, growth in vivo, and re-implantation into defect. Potentially the best option as host hyaline cartilage is formed.
- **Advantages**: Hyaline cartilage formed with potential for best longevity.
- **Disadvantages**: Two operations needed, not available everywhere, long process, technically demanding.
- **Outcomes**:
  - RCTs have shown mixed results, but several show superiority over microfracture and mosaicplasty. However, these treatments also gave good results in the same trials.

### Chondrocyte Implantation – Matrix Associated Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI)
- Chondrocytes are incorporated into a porcine collagen membrane, which gives a more even cell distribution and makes placement of the cells easier.
- Shown good results, some better than ACI, although disadvantages are similar.

### Conclusion
- Conflicting evidence for more advanced techniques with benefits from ‘lesser’ methods. Therefore, first-line treatment should be microfracture/mosaicplasty for standard lesions and situations.
