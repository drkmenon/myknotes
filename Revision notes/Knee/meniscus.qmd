### Biomechanics
- **Load sharing function** due to high conformity:
  - Increasing contact area decreases contact stress
- **Lateral meniscus** bears more load than medial
- **Lateral meniscus** is more mobile, hence less frequently injured
- Together, the menisci:
  - Absorb 50% of load in extension
  - Absorb 90% at 90 degrees flexion
- Contact stress increases in proportion to the amount of meniscus resected

### Composition
- **75% water**
- **1% dry weight proteoglycan**
- **Type 1 collagen** mainly (50% dry weight)
- Collagen types 2, 3, 5, and 6 also identified

### Blood Supply
- From **medial and lateral geniculate arteries** via **perivascular capillary plexus** which infiltrates the periphery
- 3 zones: Only the peripheral 1/3 is vascularized
  - At birth, the majority of the meniscus is vascular
  - By 10 years old, an avascular region develops

### Injury
- Rare in those <10 years old
- Acute or chronic
- Mechanism: Typically pivoting or deep flexion

### Signs & Symptoms
- Slow onset effusion
- Recurrent effusions
- Positive **McMurray’s** test (only accurate in 75%)
  - False positives due to other pathology
- Catching, locking, sharp localized pain – mechanical symptoms

### Imaging
- **Weight-bearing X-ray**:
  - Rule out OCD (Osteochondritis Dissecans)
  - Screen for OA changes
  - Signs typical of a discoid meniscus:
    1. Squaring of lateral femoral condyle (LFC)
    2. Widened lateral joint space
    3. Hypoplasia of lateral tibial spine
    4. Cupping of lateral plateau
- **MRI**:
  - High negative predictive value
  - Tear must exit onto the articular surface on two consecutive slices

### Classification of Tears
- By morphology, location (zone), and stability
  - **Medial meniscus (MM)** tears are more common
  - **Lateral meniscus (LM)** resection causes a higher increase in contact pressures
- **Complex tears**: Multiple tear directions, don’t fit one pattern

### Management
Best outcomes are seen in:
- Younger patients
- Stable knees (especially ACL intact)
- Normal alignment
- No evidence of arthritis

#### Tears Most Amenable to Non-Operative Management:
- Any stable or asymptomatic tear
- Small radial tears
- Horizontal cleavage tears of <1 cm in length
- Chronic tears associated with arthritis

### Partial Meniscectomy
- Best for **central zone tears** (white on white)
- Horizontal cleavage, radial, oblique, and flap tears
- Displaced bucket handle tears
- Patients over 40
- Delayed diagnosis/chronic tears

#### Bucket Handle Resection Technique
1. Reduce the tear
2. Detach anteriorly
3. Perform a **crocodile roll**
4. Detach towards the posterior horn

### Meniscal Repair
- 75-90% good results when performed in correct indications
- Preferred in young patients with large (especially lateral) tears
- **Best candidates**:
  - Young patients
  - Red-Red zone (peripheral) tear
  - Longitudinal tear >1cm (even a bucket handle if well reduced)
  - Acute diagnosis
  - Early surgery
- **If ACL injury present**:
  - Repair with associated ACL reconstruction – success 90%
  - Repair without ACL reconstruction – success 30%
  - Repair in a knee without ACL tear – success 80%
  - **Conclusion**: ACL tears and meniscal repairs together are more successful than meniscal repair alone.

#### Techniques of Repair:
- **Open**: For posterior horn tears
- **Inside-out**: Gold standard with vertical mattress sutures
- **Outside-in**: For anterior horn tears
- **All-inside**: Uses stents and absorbable sutures – less NV injury, but not proven to be better than inside-out with vertical mattress

- **Repair Techniques**:
  - A: Open repair of medial meniscus (right knee)
  - B: Outside-in repair of medial meniscus (right knee)
  - C: Inside-out repair of lateral meniscus (right knee)
  - D: All-inside repair of lateral meniscus (right knee)

### Meniscal Transplantation
- **Allograft meniscus** for large resections in young patients, especially on the lateral side
- **Best results** when fixation is with a bone block
- **Poor results** if:
  - ACL deficient
  - Malalignment
  - Osteoarthritis (OA) present

### Discoid Meniscus
- Typically lateral
- Typical symptom: Popping in extension in a young person
- **Classification**:
  - Type 1: Incomplete
  - Type 2: Complete
  - Type 3: Wrisberg variant (detached at posterior horn)
- **Meniscofemoral ligaments** are the only structures holding the meniscus down – amenable to repair
- **Typical X-ray findings**:
  1. Increased lateral joint space
  2. Squaring of LFC
  3. Cupping of lateral plateau
  4. Hypoplastic lateral tibial spine

#### Management:
- **Saucerization**: Shape to accommodate LFC
- **Resection of tears**
- **Repair of Wrisberg variant (type 3)**
- Nothing if incidental finding

### Meniscal Cysts
- Associated with lateral meniscal horizontal cleavage tears
- Fluctuating cystic area at the lateral joint line associated with pain
- **Treatment**: Treat the underlying tear
  - Decompress cyst from inside out

### Baker’s Cyst (Popliteal Cyst)
- Usually between the **gastrocnemius medial head** and **semimembranosus**
- Associated with chronic degenerate medial posterior horn tears
- Treating the tear usually resolves the cyst
