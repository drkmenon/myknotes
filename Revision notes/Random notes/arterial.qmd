### Early Management

-   **Vascular Referral**
-   Follow ATLS protocol.
-   Direct **pressure** over open wound.
-   Avoid clamping if possible.
-   Relocate, realign and splint the limb.
-   Neuro-vascular examination
-   Many pulses will reappear after realignment.

### Key Signs

-   Expanding hematoma may indicate worsening injury.
-   **Absent Pulses**
-   Altered sensation

### Revascularisation injury

A delay of more than 3-4 hours will lead to warm ischemia, irreversible tissue damage and increase the risk of amputation. Delayed vascularisation also lead to myoglobulinuria and death.

Duplex, CT angeogram need not be done.

### Approach

Temporary shunt –\> assess vascularity –\> skeletal stabilisation –\> definitive procedure –\> nerve repair if any –\>Fasciotomy
