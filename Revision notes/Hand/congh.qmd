## Congenital Deformities of the Hand & Upper Limb

### Classification - Swanson
1. **Failure of formation** - A part doesn’t form properly
2. **Failure of differentiation** - Part forms but does not differentiate
3. **Duplication**
4. **Overgrowth**
5. **Undergrowth**
6. **Other** - e.g., Constriction ring syndrome

### Failure of Formation
1. Symbrachydactyly
2. Radial, central, or Ulna club hand

### Embryonic Development
- Occurs along 3 axes:
  1. **Proximal to Distal** – longitudinal growth
     - Controlled by Apical Epidermal Ridge (AER)
  2. **Radial to Ulna**
     - Zone of Polarized Activity (ZPA)
     - Sonic Hedgehog gene
  3. **Dorsal to Volar**
     - Less important in anomaly development

- Failure of formation may be:
  - **Transverse Arrest**
  - **Longitudinal arrest** (radial, central, or ulna)

#### Transverse Arrest
- Can occur at any level – Proximal 1/3 forearm most common
- Less common than longitudinal arrest syndromes
- **Symbrachydactyly**
  - Absence of part or all fingers – does not affect metacarpals
  - When associated with ipsilateral chest wall deformity → **Poland Syndrome**

#### Longitudinal Arrest – Radial, Central, or Ulna Deficiency

##### Radial Deficiency (Radial Club Hand/Radial Hemimelia)
- Right > Left arm
- Male > Female
- 50% bilateral
- **Typical Deformity:**
  - Short upper limb with marked radial deviation of wrist
  - Bowed thickened ulna
  - Thumb always affected (except in TAR syndrome)
  - Thumb/Radius/radial carpal bones may be hypoplastic or absent
  - Humerus, glenoid, scapula may also be abnormal if severe
- **Associated Conditions:**
  - **VATER Syndrome** (Vertebral anomaly, anus imperforate, tracheo-esophageal fistula, renal and radial dysplasia)
  - **TAR Syndrome** (Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius) – **Thumbs normal!**
- **Classification (Heikel):**
  1. Short Radius
  2. Hypoplastic Radius
  3. Partial Absence of Radius
  4. Absent Radius
- **Management Principles:**
  - Educate patients
  - Genetic screening
  - Screen for other systemic anomalies
  - Centralize carpus on ulna
  - Pollicize a digit – allows pincer grip
  - Maintain motion

##### Central Deficiency (Cleft Hand)
- Never affects proximal to carpus
- Metacarpals absent (distinguishes it from Symbrachydactyly)
- Carpus may be affected
- 50% bilateral
- Autosomal dominant inheritance
- Often other associated abnormalities
- **Two Components:**
  1. Central Cleft (associated syndactyly or polydactyly)
  2. Hypoplastic Thumb
- **Management:**
  - Dysfunction mainly due to thumb hypoplasia – treatment primarily aimed at thumb reconstruction
  - Closing the cleft is primarily aesthetic

##### Ulna Deficiency (Ulna Club Hand)
- Less common than radial or central deficiency
- Radius always present but never normal
- Ulna digits or ulna itself is hypoplastic or absent
- Polydactyly, syndactyly, absent digits on ulna side of hand
- Elbow often unstable/stiff – deficient ulnohumeral articulation
- **Management:**
  - Address elbow contracture/instability, release syndactyly

### Failure of Differentiation
- Bony or soft tissue contractures & deformities:
  1. Syndactyly
  2. Arthrogryposis
  3. Camptodactyly
  4. Clinodactyly

#### Syndactyly
- Fusion of digits
- Male > Female
- 50% bilateral
- Autosomal Dominant inheritance
- Most common in 3rd web space (50%)
- **Classification:**
  1. **Simple** – Soft tissue only (web space webbing)
  2. **Complex** – Bone and soft tissue involvement
  3. **Complicated** – Part of a syndrome
- **Associated Syndromes:**
  - **Apert's Syndrome** – Midface hypoplasia, complicated syndactyly, visceral abnormalities
- **Management Principles:**
  - Generally treat after 1 year old
  - Often require skin grafts due to inadequate skin after separation
  - Avoid concurrent release of adjacent syndactylies – risk of devascularization

#### Arthrogryposis
- A spectrum of presentations
- May be part of a wider condition (**Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital**)
- Due to lack of fetal movement (myogenic or neuromuscular cause?)
- Intellectually normal or advanced
- **Typical Hand Appearance:**
  - Thumb adducted (thumb-in-palm)
  - Ulna deviated wrist
  - Flexed fingers
- **Management Principles:**
  - Improve ROM
  - Provide function
  - Hand therapy (passive stretching, splinting)
  - Surgery: Soft tissue release, fusion, corrective osteotomy, tendon transfer

#### Camptodactyly
- **Flexion deformity of PIPJ** – resembles a boutonniere deformity
- **Aetiology:**
  - Flexor-extensor imbalance
  - Abnormal lumbrical insertion
- Usually affects little finger (can be multiple)
- **Management:**
  - Reassure & encourage non-operative treatment
  - Surgery for severe symptomatic deformities (soft tissue release or fusion)

#### Clinodactyly
- Angular deformity of the finger at PIPJ
- Usually affects the little finger
- Due to abnormal shaped middle phalanx (**Delta phalanx**)
- **Associated with Down’s Syndrome (25%)**
- **Management:**
  - Usually none required
  - Osteotomy +/- fusion if severe

## Duplication - Polydactyly

1. Pre Axial - radial  
2. Central  
3. Post Axial – ulna  
4. Mirror Hand & Multiple Hand  

### Pre-Axial Polydactyly – Thumb duplication  
- Most common type  
- More in Europeans  
- Refers to various forms of thumb duplication  
- Mostly spontaneous and isolated but can be associated with syndromes  
  - Holt-Oram  
  - Fanconi Anaemia  
  - Blackfan-diamond anaemia  

#### Classification - Wassel  
1. Bifid Distal Phalanx - Rarest  
2. Duplicated Distal Phalanx  
3. Bifid Proximal Phalanx  
4. Duplicated proximal phalanx - Most common (45%)  
5. Bifid Metacarpal  
6. Duplicated Metacarpal  
7. Triphalangia  

**Remember by:**  
- Odd numbers are bifid from distal to proximal (type 1 bifid P3)  
- Even numbers are duplications of the previous phalanx (type 2 duplicated P3)  

#### Management  
- Educate family  
- Genetic counseling  
- Screen for other anomalies  
- Preservation of the skeleton of one thumb, excising the other but using its soft tissues to augment preserved thumb  
  - Remove the smaller thumb - usually radial  
  - Maintains UCL  
  - Rebalance soft tissues  
- **Bilhaut-Cloquet**  
  - Remove central components of both thumbs  
  - Combine the two to make a new thumb  
  - Stiffness and deformities are problematic – rarely performed  

### Post Axial (Ulna) Polydactyly  
- 2nd most common  
- Much more common in Africans  
  - Isolated usually  
  - Autosomal dominant  
- In Caucasians  
  - Likely to be part of a complex genetic abnormality  
- Refers to duplication of ulna digits  
  - From skin tags to true duplication of digit  

#### Management Principles  
- Same principles as pre-axial polydactyly  
  - Remove the outer (ulna) digit; balance the soft tissues  

### Central Polydactyly  
- Very rare  
- Duplication of central digits  
- Often associated with a complicated syndactyly  

#### Management  
- Amputation is better for single digit affliction  
- Reconstruction for multiple or thumb  

### Mirror Hand & Multiple Hand  
- Exceedingly rare form of duplication  
- Mirror hand and ulna digits are duplicated around a common central digit  
  - Radius is absent.  
- Multiple hand is presence of a duplicate hand  

### Overgrowth - Macrodactyly  
- Enlargement of a digit or multiple digits  
- Very rare  
- Spontaneous or secondary to another condition  
  - Maffuci syndrome; proteus syndrome; neurofibromatosis  
- Treatment is very difficult – a normal digit cannot be restored  

### Undergrowth  
1. Hypoplasia  
2. Brachydactly  

#### Hypoplasia/Aplasia  
- Uncommon  
- Most common type is thumb Hypoplasia or Aplasia  
- Spontaneous or part of a syndrome  
- Often associated or cross over with failure of formation  
  - Especially radial club hand  
- **Classification (Blauth)**  
  - 5 Types from short to absent thumb  

#### Goal of treatment  
- Maintain or create a thumb to act as a post  
- Key to decision making is stability of CMCJ  
- Pollicisation if CMCJ incompetent  

### Brachydactyly  
- Short fingers – normal structure but small bones  

### Other Conditions  
#### Congenital amniotic band syndrome  
- In utero amniotic bands cause constriction or amputation of digits/limb  
- Proximal to constriction, the limb is normal  
- Not properly understood  
- Streeter’s dysplasia  

#### Kirner’s Deformity  
- Bowed distal phalanx  
- Often mistaken for Clinodactyly  
- No functional deficit  
- Surgery is cosmetic  

#### Madelung Deformity  
- More common in females  
- Usually presents as minimally symptomatic deformity as an adolescent  

#### Aetiology  
- Premature fusion of the volar-ulnar part of the distal radial epiphysis  
- Results in:  
  - Prominent Ulna head  
  - Volar-ulnar subluxation of the carpus  

#### Management  
- Restore distal radius anatomy, reduce DRUJ and improve ROM  
- Techniques  
  - Distal radius osteotomy, ulna-shortening osteotomy etc.  

### Trigger Thumb  
- Not clear if congenital or acquired.  
- May be hereditary  
- Often bilateral  
- Presents with fixed flexed IPJ  

#### Aetiology  
- Due to a nodule (Notta’s nodule) in FPL just beyond A1 pulley  
- Prevents tendon passage  

#### Management  
- Splint before 1 year old  
- Surgery to release A1 pulley  
  - After 2 years (may spontaneously resolve)  
  - Before 4 years (contracture & stiffness will hinder results)  

### Trigger Finger  
- Rare  
- Different pathology to adult trigger finger or pediatric trigger thumb  
- Usually due to anatomical abnormality between FDP and FDS  
- A1 pulley release is unlikely to be curative alone  

### Congenital Clasped Thumb  
- Weakness of EPL and/or EPB causes decreased active extension  
- Flexors overpower thumb  
- Treated with tendon transfers  
- May need contracture release or osteotomy if stiff deformity  

### Congenital Dislocation of the Radial Head  
- Often bilateral  
- 60% have another skeletal abnormality  

#### X Ray features  
- Hypoplastic capitellum  
- Rounded Radial head  
- Long radius and short ulna  

#### Management  
- None if function good  
- Excision of radial head if painful – uncommon  

### Symphalangism  
- Congenital stiffness of the digits at PIPJ  
- Usually ulna digits  
- Manifests as the child starts using hands  
- Loss of skin creases  
- XR shows small irregular joints  

#### Associations  
- Alperts  
- Radial club hand  
- Hearing loss  

#### Management  
- Non-operative in children  
- In adults if functionally limiting, bony osteotomies can be performed
