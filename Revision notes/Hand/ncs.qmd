## Electromyography (EMG)
- Direct measurement of the electrical activity in a given muscle  
  - Insertion of an electrode into a specific muscle  
  - Used to establish if a particular muscle is innervated  

## Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)
- Used to measure electrical activity along a sensory, motor, or mixed nerve  
  - **Motor nerves** – antegrade  
  - **Sensory or Mixed nerves** – retrograde  

## Definitions

### Latency  
- The time in ms for conduction between two points along a nerve  

### Amplitude  
- The extent of the conducted signal (millivolts)  
- Indicates how many of the nerve fibers are working  

### Velocity  
- The speed/distance between two points  
- **Latency and velocity** measure the quality of nerve conduction  
- **Amplitude** measures the quantity of nerve conduction  

## Factors Affecting Nerve Conduction
- **Age of person**  
  - Correlates with the degree of myelination  
  - Slower in very young or elderly  
- **Temperature**  
  - Slows with decreasing temperature (optimum 30°C)  
- **Limb**  
  - Upper limb conduction is faster than lower limb  
- **Location in the nerve**  
  - Proximal conduction is faster within a given nerve  
- **The nerve itself**  
  - Different nerves conduct at different velocities  

## Motor Nerve Conduction
- Measured by supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve  
- Recording of the generated waveform with a needle in a muscle  
  - *e.g.*, APB for CTS  
- Measurement is called:  
  - **CMAP**, **MUAP**, or **M wave**  
  - Compound motor action potential / Motor unit action potential  
  - All mean the same thing  
- Latency, amplitude, and velocity of the CMAP are all calculated  
- **Motor conduction velocity (MCV)** is calculated separately  
  - By measuring latencies at different sites and the distance between the two sites  

## Sensory Nerve Conduction
- Measured by supramaximal stimulation of a sensory nerve  
- Usually in a **retrograde** fashion  
- Provides the **Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP)**  
- Latency, amplitude, and velocity are all calculated  
- **Sensory Conduction Velocity (SCV)** is calculated separately  
  - Same method as MCV  

## Measures of Proximal Conduction

### F Wave Response
- When a motor nerve is supramaximally stimulated to measure the CMAP, a **retrograde (antidromic) conduction** also occurs  
- Since this does not cross synapses, it behaves like an echo  
- Represents stimulation of anterior horn cells at the root level  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Longer latency and smaller amplitude than CMAP  
  - Called the **F wave**  
- **Clinical significance:**  
  - Absence or reduction may indicate a root level problem  
  - Especially if **distal conduction (CMAP) is normal**  
  - Muscles are innervated by multiple roots, so a single root injury may not significantly affect it  
  - More useful for diagnosing **multi-root problems**  
    - *e.g.*, Plexopathies, Guillain-Barré Syndrome  

### H Reflex
- Effectively an **electrical deep tendon reflex**  
- Elicited by submaximal stimulation of muscle stretch receptors, which return  
  (afferent) to the anterior horn cells  
- Results in a **motor response via a monosynaptic reflex**, which is recorded  
- **Difficult to measure**, so not widely used  
- **Absence is noted in:**  
  - Radiculopathy  
  - Polyneuropathy  
  - Elderly  

## Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP)
- Used for **spinal cord monitoring** and investigation of **proximal lesions**  
- **Evoked potentials** from the central nervous system recorded at a **peripheral site**
