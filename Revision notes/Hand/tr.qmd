## Classification
- **Benign Bony**
- **Benign Soft Tissue**
- **Malignant Bony**
- **Malignant Soft Tissue**
- **Neural Origin**
- **Skin Malignancy**

---

## Benign Bony Tumours

### Enchondroma
- Usually solitary incidental finding
- Cartilage tumour

#### X-Ray Features
- Expansile lytic lesion with cortical scalloping and calcified matrix
- Usually in MC – less common as move distally in finger
- Never undergoes malignant change if isolated

#### Management
- Leave alone; usually heal after fracture
- Curettage and grafting if not or re-fracture and symptomatic

### Olliers Disease
- Multiple enchondromatosis all over hand
  - 20% undergo malignant change to osteo- or chondrosarcoma

### Maffuci Syndrome
- Osteochondromatosis with associated haemangiomas
  - **100% malignant transformation**

---

### Osteochondroma (Exostosis)
- Benign – grows away from joint – has a cartilage cap
- Histology similar to growth plate – stops growing with maturity usually
- May be associated with **Hereditary Multiple Osteochondromatosis (HME)**
  - **1% risk of malignant change in HME**

---

### Osteoid Osteoma
- **10-30 years old**
- Proximal phalanx or carpal bones
- Night pain – dull, diffuse, and achy
- Natural history is to resolve after **18 months**

#### X-Ray Features
- Osteolytic nidus with surrounding sclerosis – round and small **(<1cm)**

#### Management
- **NSAIDs and reassurance**
- Otherwise excise
  - **Pre-op CT/MRI** to accurately define location
  - Otherwise **recurrence high** with incomplete excision
  - **CT-guided RF ablation**

---

### Giant Cell Tumour of Bone
- **2nd most common location is distal radius**
- May be incidental, cause ache, or present after fracture

#### X-Ray Features
- Eccentric metaphyseal lesion which is locally aggressive
- Heterogeneous matrix and expansile with cortical thinning
- **Campannaci classification**
- Can metastasize to lung in **2%**

#### Management
- **Curettage and grafting/cementing/allografts** etc.
  - **En bloc excision and endoprosthesis**
  - **Arthrodesis with grafting**
  - **Recurrence rate up to 30%** (worsened by radiotherapy)

---

### Turret Exostosis
- Traumatic sub-periosteal new bone formation
- Symptomatic if forms under nail or within extensor expansion of digit
- Causes mechanical symptoms

#### Management
- **Excision once mature** (to minimize recurrence)

---

### CMC Boss
- Juxtaarticular Osteochondroma usually from **3rd CMCJ**
- **Excision if symptomatic** – consider **CMCJ fusion if degenerate**

---

## Malignant Tumours of Bone & Cartilage
- **Very rare**
- Most common: **Chondrosarcoma > Osteosarcoma**

### Chondrosarcoma
- **Only 1%** of all chondrosarcomas occur in the hand
- Usually transformation in **enchondromatosis**
- **MC or proximal phalanx** usually
- **Chondroid matrix**

#### Management
- **Radio/Chemo not effective**
- **Surgical excision/Amputation**

---

## Benign Soft Tissue Tumours

### Giant Cell Tumour of Tendon Sheath
**AKA - PVNS/localized nodular tenosynovitis**
- Benign but locally aggressive with **high recurrence**
- Slow-growing mass over years – may cause discomfort
- Unknown etiology

#### X-Ray Features
- Soft tissue mass sometimes with bony erosions  

#### Histology
- **Haemosiderin**, multinucleated cells (**not giant cells**)

#### Macroscopic Appearance
- Lobulated, orange/brown lesion often encircling other structures

#### Management
- **Marginal excision** – **high recurrence if incomplete**

---

### Glomus Tumour
- Arises from **glomus bodies** in fingertips (modulate heat)

#### Presentation
- **Intense pain**
- **Temperature sensitivity**
- **Fingertip reddish mass**
- **Nail beds obliterated**

#### X-Ray Features
- **Bone scalloping**
- **MRI to confirm**

#### Management
- **Marginal excision** – recurrence high if incomplete

---

### Pyogenic Granuloma
- **Neither pyogenic nor granulomatous!**
- Disorder of **angiogenesis**
- **Post-traumatic**, pedunculated, friable red lump

#### Management
- **Silver nitrate if small**
- **Surgical marginal excision**

---

### Epidermal Inclusion Cyst (Dermoid Cyst)
- **Traumatic implantation** of keratinizing epithelium into dermis
- **Anywhere on hand**, often between fingers

#### Management
- **Marginal excision**
- **Can mimic other diagnoses**

---

### Dermatofibroma
- **Locally invasive, recurrent lesions**
- **Excise but biopsy** to differentiate from malignancy

---

### Ganglions
- **See separate notes**

---

## Tumours of Neural Origin

### Schwannoma
- **Most common peripheral nerve tumour of the upper limb**
- **Painless mass with positive Tinel’s sign**
- **Eccentric on nerve fibre**
  - Can be **shelled out while preserving the nerve**

#### Histology
- **Cell of origin:** Schwann cell
- **Composed of Antoni A (cells) and Antoni B (matrix) regions**

---

### Neurofibroma
- May be **isolated** or part of **NF1**
- **Slow-growing painless mass**
- **Arise centrally** from nerve fascicles
  - **Can’t be shelled out** without sacrificing nerve – may need graft

---

### Dejerine-Sottas Disease
- **Type 3 HSMN**
- **Localized swelling of peripheral nerve**
  - Due to **hypertrophic interstitial neuropathy**
  - **Usually seen in median nerve** – may require **CTR**
  - **Can occur in foot** → cavovarus foot

#### Management
- **Cannot be shelled out without sacrificing axons**

---

## Soft Tissue Malignant Tumours
- **Rare**
- Most common:

### Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
- **Most common malignant hand tumour**
- Arises from **skin or subungual areas**

### Other Malignant Tumours
- **Synovial Sarcoma**
- **Epithelioid Sarcoma**
- **Melanoma** (can also occur subungual – more common in foot)

---

### Soft Tissue Sarcomas
- Usually **>5cm** in size
- **Young adults**
- **Irregular, painful, fast-growing, and invasive**

#### **Epithelioid Sarcoma**
- **Most common tumour of the hand**
- **Young adults**
- **Spreads to lymph nodes**
- **Wide or radical excision**
- **Chemo/radiotherapy not fully proven to be useful**

#### **Synovial Sarcoma**
- **Poor prognosis**
- **Epithelial and spindle cells**
- **Young adults**
- **More common in the foot**
- **Wide or radical excision is treatment of choice**
- **Adjuvant chemotherapy is useful**
