### Definition
- An autoimmune systemic disease causing an inflammatory symmetric polyarthropathy primarily affecting synovial lined structures
- In hand typically spares DIPJ

### Classic X-Ray Features
- Peri-articular erosions
- Osteopenia
- Joint subluxation and deformity

### Medical Treatment
#### 3 Groups of Drugs
1. NSAIDS
2. Corticosteroids
3. Disease modifying drugs
   - Only DMARDs can prevent joint destructions

#### DMARDs
- Split into Non-biologic and Biologic

**Non-Biologic:**

- Methotrexate
  - Traditionally the only DMARD
  - Best used as an anchor drug in combination with biologic agent

**Biologic DMARDs:**

- Further split into two categories:
  - TNF-alpha inhibitors
    - Etanercept
  - Interleukin-1 antagonists
    - Anakinara (shown to improve radiographic outcomes)

### Classification of RA Joint Disease: Larsen Staging
1. Normal joint
2. Periarticular osteopenia, minimal narrowing
3. Joint erosions, mild narrowing
4. Moderate destructive narrowing
5. End-stage joint destruction but preservation of joint surfaces
6. Mutilating disease, complete articular destruction

### Surgical Concepts
- Many patients have adapted to severe deformities
- Be specific in what the functional deficit you are trying to improve is
- Not all deformities need correcting simultaneously
- Patients often happy enough after one procedure

### Wrist
#### Natural History
- Soft tissue attenuation, synovitis, and rupture lead to bony deformities
- **Carpus:**
  - Synovitis around wrist & extensor tendons
  - Scapholunate ligament degeneration
  - Extrinsic volar ligament attenuation and rupture
  - Scaphoid flexion
  - Radial column collapse
- **DRUJ:**
  - Caput ulna syndrome
  - ECU subsheath rupture
  - Allows carpus to supinate
  - Stretches dorsal DRUJ restraints
  - Ulna head prominence – piano key sign
  - Eventually:
    - Midcarpal instability and collapse
    - Pan-carpal arthritis

#### Causes of DRUJ Instability

- High vascularity in pre-styloid recess leads to rapid synovitis
- Attenuates ulna-sided ligament supports – ECU subsheath
- ECU tendon infiltration - instability
- Arthritic destruction of DRUJ articular surfaces

#### Extensor Tendon Problems

- Synovial infiltration of tendon sheaths – tenosynovitis
- Tendon rupture – especially at wrist level
- Tendon subluxation at MCP level

#### Wrist Synovitis

- 'Hourglass swelling' on dorsum of wrist
- Indicates impending tendon rupture
- Synovium proximal and distal to extensor retinaculum

#### Tendon Rupture at Wrist

- Infiltration of the tendons themselves
- Attrition at bony prominences – DRUJ, Lister’s tubercle
  - DRUJ typical because of Caput Ulna prominence
- Palmar subluxated carpus
- Dorsal subluxated Ulna head
- Rupture occurs sequentially from ulna to radial
  - EDM then EDC and so on

#### Vaughan Jackson Syndrome

- EDM rupture due to caput ulna
- Test by holding other fingers flexed-inability to extend little finger
  - Eliminates any juncturae or an EDC to little finger

### MCPJ Tendon Problems

- **Loss of extension at MCPJ may be caused by:**
  1. Subluxation
  2. Tendon rupture
  3. Joint dislocation
  4. PIN palsy
- **On examination they can be differentiated by:**
  - **Subluxation:** tendon palpable and relocates with extension
  - **Rupture:** No palpable tendon or power in any position
  - **Dislocation:** XR and palpable + visible deformity
  - **PIN Palsy:** Other muscles affected - Tenodesis retained
    - (slight extension of fingers with maximal passive flexion at wrist)

### Flexor Tendon Problems
#### Tenosynovitis

- Painful thickened volar aspect fingers
- Unable to pinch skin on examination
- Crepitus and pain
- Inject with steroid
- Oral drugs
- Splintage
- Surgical synovectomy if no improvement to prevent rupture
- Be fairly aggressive at preventing tendon rupture

#### Tendon Rupture

- FDS, FDP, or both at any level
- Primary repair or grafting has poor results
- Consider DIPJ fusion if FDP alone
- Buddy to adjacent flexor if at wrist level
- Tendon grafting may be needed if both ruptured in finger – unpredictable
- All tendon procedures should have a synovectomy concurrently

#### Mannerfelt Syndrome

- Isolated rupture of FPL or sometimes index FDP
- Attrition on volar STT joint osteophyte
- May be confused with AIN palsy
- Treat with thumb IPJ fusion
  - FDS transfer or tendon grafting has poor results

#### Triggering
- Usually due to tenosynovitis rather than A1 pulley thickening
- Preserve pulleys if possible (maintain stability of tendon)
- Excise synovitis

### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

- Either concurrent or due to synovitis in tunnel
- Explore carpal tunnel fully if RA present
- Excise synovitis and decompress nerve

### Surgery for Wrist RA
**Goals:**

- Prophylactic or corrective
- Pain relief
- Prevention of tendon rupture
- Correct deformities contributing to functional impairment
- Restore function

#### DRUJ Procedures

- **Darrach’s:** Distal ulna resection - often leave styloid tip
  - Possible in older low demand patients
  - Comparable pain relief but grip strength poor
  - Complications:
    - Ulna translation of the carpus into defect
    - Can do concurrent RL fusion to prevent

- **Suave Kapanji:** DRUJ fusion with Ulna osteotomy to maintain rotation
  - Main complication: Stump pain - abutment against radius
  - Lower complication rate than Darrach
  - Better for younger patients

- **DRUJ Arthroplasty:**
  - No long-term results and loosening/pain are problems

## Radiocarpal Arthritis

### Fusion or Arthroplasty

#### Fusions: Limited or Total

**Radiocarpal Fusion (Chamay) (Radius to Lunate and Scaphoid)**

- Prophylactic to prevent ulna subluxation of carpus
- Halts natural progression outlined above
- Contraindicated in presence of midcarpal OA

**Total Wrist Fusion**

- Predictably good results with dorsal fusion plates/pins
- Some prefer not using dorsal plates because of poor bone
- AO locking wrist fusion plate is better though
- Pain relief good and function satisfactory
- Complication rate is low
- Pseudoarthroses tend to be pain free

**Surgical Steps**

- Longitudinal dorsal approach
- Dorsal half carpal bones and distal radius fragmented and used as graft
- IM pins, Steiman pins, or AO fusion plate
- For bilateral cases try and avoid bilateral fusion
- Consider arthroplasty of one wrist

### Wrist Arthroplasty
- Better results but still evolving
- Rheumatoid arthritis is a possible indication
- Improved results with the Universal 2 wrist replacement
  - Should have:
    - Minimal deformity
    - Good bone stock
    - Intact extensors

## MCP Joints

### Typical Deformities
- Volar joint subluxation due to synovitis
- Ulna drift caused by tendon subluxation

### Functional Problems
- Difficult to pinch if index drifted ulnar ward
- Difficulty cupping objects
- Aesthetically displeasing

### Surgical Options
**Soft Tissue or Bony Procedures**

**Synovectomy & Cross Intrinsic Transfer of Lateral Bands**

- Early disease only
- Prevents subluxation

**Relocation of Tendon**

- Tightening of radial and release of ulna soft tissues
- Contraindicated if joint affected

**Fusion**

- Not usually good option as finger motion is initiated at MCPJ
- Fusion is functionally poor at MCPJ
- Last resort

**Arthroplasty**

- Usually the best solution
- Shortens digit > reduces soft tissue tension and deforming forces
- Must be combined with tendon relocation and soft tissue balance
- Concurrent wrist re-alignment to prevent chronic instability
- Better deformity correction in radial joints
- Silicone spacers most common
  - Traditionally the Swanson
  - Currently Neuflex is most common
  - Scar tissue formed stabilises joints despite loosening
- Pyrocarbon unconstrained joints not good for RA but good in OA

**Surgical Principles**

- Correct proximal wrist deformities and tendons first
- Multiple or single transverse or longitudinal incisions
- Release capsule and intrinsics
- Excise MCPJ head distal to collaterals
- Imbricate lax radial capsule and sagittal band in closure

### Volar Plate Arthroplasty

- Interposition of volar plate in joint - pain relieving
- Unreliable correction of deformity
- Best reserved if bone too small for arthroplasty

## Tendon Rupture

- Sequentially occurs from EDM then each EDC
- All procedures should address the tendon deficiency and the cause

### Tendon Transfer Options

- **Only EDM ruptured**
  - End-to-side transfer (stitch end of EDM to EDC of ring finger)
- **If ulna 2 tendons ruptured**
  - EIP transfer to power ring & little or,
  - EIP to EDM and buddy ring to middle EDC
- **If ulna 3 tendons ruptured**
  - EIP to ring and little
  - Middle finger end to side with Ext Indicis Communis
  - Weak extension as all fingers powered by index extensors
  - Alternative is to combine FDS into transfer
- **If all 4 tendons gone:**
  - FDS tendons transferred through interosseous membrane
  - FDS is not synergistic > function difficult to get used to
  - FDS has excellent excursion so is very useful

## Boutonniere Deformity

### Primary Cause

- Synovitis, attenuation, and rupture of central slip
- Volar subluxation of lateral bands and hyperextension of DIPJ
- Often not functionally too limiting but,
  - Patients don't like appearance
- Correction to an extended position of PIPJ can actually impair function
  - Therefore avoid for aesthetics

### Classification (Nalebuff)

- **Mild:** Mobile PIPJ, PIPJ extensor lag <15 degrees
- **Moderate:** Mobile PIPJ, PIPJ extensor lag 15-40 degrees
- **Severe:** Fixed PIPJ with loss of extension and arthritis

### Management
**Flexible Deformity:**

- **If acute:** Capener splint – allows active DIPJ motion
- **If chronic:**
  - Extensor tendon tenotomy – at distal phalanx
  - Leaves ORL intact so no mallet finger develops
  - Tendon reconstruction
  - Passive motion must be restored
  - Re-location of lateral bands or,
  - Transfer of ulna lateral band to central slip

**Fixed Deformity:**

- **Arthrodesis**
  - Gold standard – reliable and durable
- **Arthroplasty**
  - Described but deformity often recurs – more difficult to salvage

## Swan Neck Deformity

- More functionally limiting than Boutonniere
- Patient unable to flex finger and grip properly

### Causes

- **DIPJ:** Mallet finger caused by DIPJ disease or trauma
- **PIPJ:**
  - Synovitis causes volar plate attenuation or FDS rupture
  - Dorsal subluxation of lateral bands
  - Transverse and oblique ligaments incompetent
- **MCPJ:** Joint or tendon subluxation causes intrinsic tightness

### Classification (Nalebuff)

- **Type 1:** Fully flexible PIPJ with mild hyperextension
- **Type 2:** Intrinsic tightness, PIPJ tight with MCPJ extension only
- **Type 3:** PIPJ tight regardless of MCPJ position, No arthritis
- **Type 4:** Stiff, arthritic PIPJ

### Management

- Treatment based on cause of deformity and functional deficit
- **REMEMBER:** Doing nothing may be the best option
- Optimization of medical treatment prior to surgery

#### Stage-wise Treatment

- **Stage 1:**
  - Extension restricting splint if PIPJ is problem
  - DIPJ fusion if DIPJ problem
- **Stage 2:**
  - Intrinsic release
  - FDS tenodesis or volar plate advancement to prevent hyperextension
- **Stage 3:**
  - Arthrodesis of PIPJ + intrinsic release
  - Can MUA PIPJ to restore motion then do as for stage 2
- **Stage 4:** Arthrodesis
- **Arthroplasty:** PIPJ results are poor in RA

## Thumb Deformities

- **Thumb Boutonniere (MCPJ problem)**
- **Thumb Swan Neck (CMCJ problem)**
- Mainstay are fusion procedures to provide a strong post for grip
  - Instability rather than loss of motion causes the most symptoms
  - Fuse the appropriate joint
  - If both CMCJ and MCPJ unstable can fuse both but limits function badly
  - Consider CMCJ arthroplasty and MCPJ fusion or just fuse MCPJ

### Classification of Rheumatoid Thumb (Nalebuff)

1. Type 1: Boutonniere (MCPJ flexion) – most common
2. Type 2: Boutonniere with CMCJ dislocation or arthritis (rare)
3. Type 3: Swan Neck (CMCJ adduction and flexion)
4. Type 4: Ulna collateral ligament laxity
5. Type 5: Swan Neck with no adduction of metacarpal (rare)
6. Type 6: Mutilating disease – gross joint destruction
