## Biomechanics & Anatomy
- The carpus is comprised of 2 rows:
  - Distal row is virtually fixed
  - Proximal row is an intercalated segment
- No muscle attachments
- Movements are dependent on the action of the wrist joint, the connections between the bones, and movements of the distal row
- The scaphoid spans both rows

## Carpal Stability
### Intrinsic Ligaments
- Short, stout ligaments between the bones of the same row
- **SLL** strongest dorsally
- **LTL** strongest volarly but less discrepancy between volar & dorsal

### Extrinsic Ligaments
- Volar are the strongest ligaments in the wrist
- Especially Radio-scapho-capitate ligament
- **Space of Poirier** is a deficient area in volar capsulo-ligamentous tissue
  - Allows dislocation of the lunate

## Kinematics
- 2/3 flexion occurs at the midcarpal joint
- 2/3 extension occurs at the radiocarpal joint
- Radial deviation causes scaphoid flexion
- Ulnar deviation causes scaphoid extension

### 3 Theories Regarding Kinematics
- **Row Theory**:
  - Distal row fixed, proximal is an intercalated segment
- **Column Theory** – Carpus is 3 columns:
  - Radial (scaphoid) – mobile column as scaphoid spans both rows
  - Central (capitate & lunate) – flexion & extension
  - Ulna Column (triquetrum & hamate) – responsible for rotation
- **Oval Theory**:
  - Compromise of the two theories

## Instability Patterns
- All injury patterns may be lesser or greater arc:
  - **Greater arc** = through bones
  - **Lesser arc** = through soft tissues
- **Gillula’s lines** (below) used to assess XRs to look for instability patterns

### Carpal Instability Dissociative (CID)
- Between bones of the same row – bony or soft tissue
- Intercalated instability refers to CID of the proximal row
- **DISI & VISI patterns**

### Carpal Instability Non-Dissociative
- Instability is between rows
- Less common and difficult to diagnose
- Mid-carpal instability is the most common pattern

### Carpal Instability Complex (CIC)
- Involves a combination of CID & CIND
- May be fractures or ligamentous instability

### Carpal Instability Adaptive (CIA)
- Compensatory instability pattern seen because of extra-carpal problems
  - Most commonly a dorsal malunited distal radius fracture leads to DISI

## Mayfield Classification of Peri-lunate Dislocation
- This is the most common pattern of Complex carpal instability

### Stages:
1. **Stage 1**: Uncoupling of scaphoid and lunate
2. **Stage 2**: Stage 1 plus uncoupling of Capitate and lunate
3. **Stage 3**: Stage 1 & 2 plus uncoupling of Lunate and Triquetrum
4. **Stage 4**: Lunate dislocation (volar usually)

- There is debate on whether lunate and perilunate dislocations are the same
  - In terms of management, they are the same thing

## Management of Specific Carpal Instability Patterns

### Scapholunate Instability (DISI)

#### Acute SLL Injury (< 4 weeks)
- Primary repair with suture anchors and K-wires
- Open repair is reported up to 6 months after injury
- Results likely to deteriorate

#### Chronic SLL Injury
- **Brunelli & Modified Brunelli Reconstruction**:
  - Involves split FCR tunneling through scaphoid and lunate
  - Good results in terms of pain relief and radiographic correction
  - At the expense of wrist stiffness
  - No proven reduction in late arthritis
- **Blatt Capsulodesis**:
  - Less commonly done
  - Involves suture of dorsal capsule to scaphoid to stop it from flexing
- **Partial Wrist Fusion**:
  - Corrective STT fusion, for instance
  - Less commonly performed
  - Technical difficulty and loss of motion

### Lunotriquetral Injury
- Rare in isolation
- Often picked up late

#### Acute
- Direct repair of LT ligament with anchors and wires

#### Chronic (more often)
- Lunotriquetral fusion
- FCU tenodesis – stops triquetrum extending relative to lunate

### Perilunate Injuries
- **Emergent Closed Reduction** usually possible:
  - Hyperdorsiflexion and thumbing lunate back in
  - Hyperdorsiflexion and pushing carpus volar to hinge on capitate

#### Definitive Treatment
- Always required
- **Dorsal Approach**
  - Anchors to repair ligaments
  - K-wires in Christmas tree pattern to maintain carpal bone alignment
  - Wires out at 8 weeks
  - Plaster for 12 weeks
  - Concurrent carpal tunnel decompression
  - Volar or dorsal approach to fix distal radius/styloid fractures

### Complications
- Median nerve injury
- Wrist stiffness
- Wrist arthrosis
- CRPS
- Proximal pole scaphoid AVN if trans-scaphoid fracture present
