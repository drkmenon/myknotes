## SLAC Wrist  
### Stages:  
- **Stage 1**: Radial styloid - scaphoid OA  
- **Stage 2**: Whole Scaphoid fossa OA  
- **Stage 3**: Mid carpal OA (Lunocapitate & Scaphocapitate OA)  
  - Capitate drives into scapholunate interval  
- **Stage 4**: Pan Carpal Arthritis  

## SNAC Wrist  
- Same stages except **Stage 4 is not usually part of it**  
- **Key Difference**:  
  - In SNAC, **proximal scaphoid pole remains attached to lunate** by SL ligament  
  - This spares the area from OA  
  - In SLAC, **SL ligament incompetence** allows OA to develop between scaphoid and lunate  
  - **Capitate drives into this area**  

## Common Features in Both  
- **Dissociative carpal instability (proximal row)**  
- **DISI (Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability)** caused by:  
  - **Bony uncoupling in SNAC** (flexed at fracture)  
  - **Soft tissue disruption in SLAC** (whole scaphoid flexed)  
- **SL Angle >60°** (normal is 40-60°)  
- **Lunate fossa of radius only affected in most severe cases**  
  - **Usually spared but more likely affected in SLAC**  
  - **Due to capitate driving into the gap, displacing lunate ulnarly**  

## Aetiology  
### SNAC  
- Traumatic non-union +/- AVN  

### SLAC  
- **Usually SL ligament trauma**  
- May be caused by **pseudogout (pyrophosphate deposition disease)**  
  - Often **bilateral** if pseudogout  
- **No evidence that SL repair prevents SLAC**  
- **Even without SLAC, SL rupture may cause persistent pain**  

## Management  

### Non-Surgical Management  
- No long-term studies on **non-operative treatment**  
- **Natural history not fully understood**  
- **Splinting, activity modification, and analgesia** may suffice for some  

### Surgical Treatment  
#### **Goals:**  
- Relieve pain  
- Maintain motion (in early stages)  
- Restore function  

#### **Broad Surgical Options:**  
1. **Wrist denervation**  
2. **Radial Styloidectomy** (+/- distal scaphoid excision in SNAC)  
3. **Limited Lunocapitate fusion** (+/- excision of triquetrum)  
4. **4-corner fusion** (+ excision of un-united proximal scaphoid)  
5. **Proximal Row Carpectomy (PRC)**  
6. **Total Wrist Fusion**  

### **Surgical Procedures**  

#### **Wrist Denervation**  
- **AIN & PIN denervation** to eliminate articular branches  
- **Unpredictable results**  
- **No change to long-term mechanics**  
- **Safe option as it does not burn surgical bridges**  

#### **Radial Styloidectomy +/- Distal Scaphoid Excision (SNAC)**  
- Useful in **early stages (esp. Stage 1)**  
- **SNAC:** Un-united distal pole excised to reduce pain  
- **Problem**: Pain may continue, and collapse may progress  
- **May be a good temporizing measure**  

#### **Isolated Lunocapitate Fusion**  
- **Scaphoid & triquetrum excision may improve union rates**  
- **Increases Radiolunate contact pressure**  
- **Outcomes equivalent to 4CF**  

#### **4-Corner Fusion (4CF)**  
- **Lunate, capitate, triquetrum, and hamate fusion**  
- **+/- Scaphoid excision**  
- **Fixation: K-wires or plates**  

##### **Problems with 4CF**  
- **Non-union risk**  
- **Broken metalware**  
- **Tendon irritation**  
- **Continued pain & restricted motion**  

##### **Key Surgical Tips for 4CF Success**  
- Use **bone graft (from distal radius)**  
- If using **spider plate**, use **2 screws per bone**  
- Avoid **burrs/power instruments**  
- **Lunate position at fusion does not affect motion**  

#### **Proximal Row Carpectomy (PRC)**  
- **Contraindicated if proximal capitate pole is severely arthritic**  
  - Will cause continued pain  
- **Advantages:**  
  - No metalware  
  - No need for fusion  
  - Faster rehab  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Slightly diminished grip strength  

#### **Choosing Between 4CF and PRC**  
- **4CF** preferred in **younger, high-demand patients**  
- **PRC** better for **older or lower-demand patients**  
- **Surgeon preference plays a large role** as both have good reported outcomes  

#### **Total Wrist Fusion**  
- **Most predictable results**  
- **Treatment of choice for Stage 4 disease** (or Stage 3 if preferred)  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - **Stiff wrist**  
  - **Hardware complications**  
  - **Non-union (especially of 3rd CMCJ)**  

## **Treatment Algorithm**  

### **Stage 1**  
- **Neurectomy**  
- **Radial styloidectomy**  

### **Stage 2**  
- **Lunocapitate fusion + scaphoid excision**  
- **PRC**  
- **4-corner fusion + scaphoid excision**  

### **Stage 3**  
- **4-corner fusion + scaphoid excision**  

### **Stage 4**  
- **Total wrist fusion**  

## **Summary**  
- **No clear evidence on natural history of SLAC/SNAC symptoms**  
- **Treatment is focused on symptom relief**  
- **Goal is to preserve motion if possible**
