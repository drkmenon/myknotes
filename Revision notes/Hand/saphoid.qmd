**JBJS AAOS Instructional Lecture 2008, AAOS 2000 (Jupiter), JBJS Br 2011 (Dias)**

## Anatomy
- Mostly covered in articular cartilage
- Spans both carpal rows
- Has a tubercle distally
- **Blood supply** (radial artery) enters from:
  - Distal tubercle
  - Dorsal ridge (non-articular) – main blood supply
    - Enters just distal to the waist
    - Blood supply is therefore retrograde
- Scapholunate interosseous ligament attaches to the proximal pole
  - Fracture of waist may result in extension of the proximal pole:
    - Due to lunate extension
  - Relative flexion of the distal pole (humpback)

## Epidemiology
- Young men, participating in sports

## Mechanism
- Sudden dorsiflexion or fall onto hand

## Classification

### Fracture Pattern - Russe
- Horizontal oblique
- Transverse
- Vertical oblique (most unstable due to shear)

### Stability – Herbert
1. **Stable**:
   - Incomplete fractures
   - Tuberosity fractures
   - <1mm displacement/gap in any plane
2. **Unstable**:
   - All complete fractures
   - more than 1mm displacement/gap
   - more than degrees SL angle
   - more than degrees radiolunate angulation
   - more than degrees CL angle
   - Angular deformity of scaphoid – difficult to assess on XR
   - Comminution
3. **Delayed Union**
4. **Non-Union**

### Location
- Tubercle
- Distal pole
- Waist
- Proximal pole

## Diagnosis

### Examination
- Snuff box pain; pain on volar aspect (better); pain on axial compression

### Imaging
- **XR and delayed XR** (30% non-diagnostic):
  - PA, Lateral, Oblique & scaphoid view
  - **Scaphoid view**:
    - 30-degree tube angulation with wrist in 20-degree ulnar deviation
    - Effectively elongates and extends the scaphoid into view
- **CT Scan** – fine cut (1mm slices) in the long axis of the scaphoid:
  - Useful to diagnose fracture; assess union and quantify deformity
  - Highly sensitive but specificity 75%
- **MRI** – useful for undisplaced fractures:
  - MRI is the gold standard investigation for diagnosis
  - High signal representing bone edema on T2
  - Highly sensitive & specific

## Management

### Why Operate?
1. Correct deformity (severe deformity is uncommon)
   - Deformity leads to carpal instability patterns (DISI usually)
2. Prevent non-union & malunion
3. Prevent SNAC development
4. Expedite return to function (soft indication)

### Non-union Risk Factors
- Smoking
- Delayed presentation and treatment >4 weeks after injury (45%)
- more than 1mm displacement at waist
- Angular deformity
- Proximal pole (AVN) (up to 80% non-union rate)
- Vertical oblique fractures:
  - Almost all distal pole and tubercle fractures heal without deformity
  - No indication for surgery

### Waist Fractures
- more than 90% union rate if undisplaced
- Rarely indicated to treat surgically
- 10% non-union rate

#### In an Undisplaced Waist Fracture:
- **Surgery** (JBJS AM 2010 meta-analysis – Dutch study including David Ring):
  - Reduced time to union
  - Quicker return to sports and work
  - Higher early satisfaction
  - Better early functional scores
  - Better early grip strength
  - Higher complication rate
- **BUT, No difference in**:
  - Union rate
  - Malunion rate
  - Cost
  - Pain
  - Long-term functional scores or grip strength

### Complications
- Non-union
- Malunion
- Scaphotrapezial OA
- Infection
- Impingement of screw

Therefore, reasonable to offer percutaneous surgery but at risk of complications

### In Displaced Waist Fractures (Dias JBJS BR Review 2011)
- Higher chance of non-union, but only 14%
- Main issue is malunion:
  - Carpal instability
  - Premature arthritis
  - Reduced wrist extension
  - More complex surgery to revise

### Proximal Pole
- Higher risk of AVN
- Non-union (up to 80%)
- SNAC
  - These risks have not actually been well quantified
- Generally accepted that we should fix all proximal pole fractures

## Treatment Options for All Fractures

### Cast Immobilization
- Above elbow not shown to be better than below
- No difference with thumb spica or not
- Neutral position
- Maintain plaster for a minimum of 8/52
  - Can take up to 12/52 for proximal pole to heal
  - Therefore, back into plaster if pain at 8 weeks
  - Remove plaster regardless at 12 weeks

### Surgery

#### Percutaneous
- II guidance
- Extend over rolled crepe and ulnar-deviate wrist to reduce fracture
- Only proceed if fracture can be reduced
- Can use wide-bore cannula to move trapezium
- Aim down center of scaphoid on AP & Lateral
- On lateral, should be aiming for the center of the lunate
- Take XR dynamic screening & obliques to ensure central placement
- Measure then pass wire distal to prevent backout
- Take 4mm off measurement for screw length

#### Volar Approach
- Workhorse approach for waist fractures
- Preserves dorsal blood supply; allows correction of deformity and grafting
- **Technique**:
  - Landmarks are tubercle and FCR
  - Hand is extended over a crepe roll
  - Longitudinal incision just radial to FCR
  - FCR retracted ulnarward
  - Curve incision radially in distal part over tubercle
  - Longitudinal incision made in the volar wrist capsule
  - Care taken to preserve radioscaphocapitate ligament
  - The non-articular portion of the proximal part of the trapezium may need to be resected
  - Capsule may be incised horizontally to gain access to the scaphotrapezial joint
  - The fracture is reduced with use of a dental pick or Kirschner wire ("joysticks")
  - Anatomic reduction should be achieved prior to fixation
  - Screw should be as long and central as possible
  - Subtract 2-4mm to allow for compression

#### Dorsal Approach
- Better for proximal pole fractures
- **Technique**:
  - Flex wrist over crepe roll to deliver proximal pole
  - Longitudinal incision centered over Lister's tubercle
  - The extensor retinaculum is longitudinally incised
  - Retract the tendons of the second & third dorsal compartments
    - May be between 3rd & 4th compartments
  - XR to confirm position
  - The wrist capsule is incised transversely over proximal pole
    - Without injuring the deeper scapholunate ligament
  - Care must be taken not to disturb the dorsal ridge:
    - Main blood supply to the scaphoid is found
  - Excellent visualization of the proximal portion of the scaphoid, especially with the wrist in maximum flexion
  - Entry point of guide wire is just radial to the scapholunate ligament origin
