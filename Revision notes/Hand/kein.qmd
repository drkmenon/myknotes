## Epidemiology
- Male > Female (2:1)
- 20-40 year olds
- Dominant hand

## Aetiology
- Unknown but likely multifactorial
- Mix of anatomical and mechanical factors leading to a susceptible lunate:

1. **Ulna –ve variance** = increased shear forces across lunate  
   - Seen in 75% of Kienbock’s cases  
   - Normal wrist loading: **80% radius, 20% ulna**  
   - With -ve ulna variance: **95% radius, 5% ulna**  

2. **20% of lunates have a single nutrient artery**

3. **Traumatic past event** that alters blood supply

4. **Repetitive microtrauma**

## Natural History
- Ischaemia → Necrosis → Sclerosis → Structural failure (Collapse) → Wrist instability → Secondary arthritis  

## Investigation

### X-Ray  
- Only positive in later stages  
- **Assessing ulna variance**  
  - Done on a **PA view with neutral rotation**  
  - Shoulder & Elbow at **90 degrees**  
  - Ulna fossa to radius – normal = **1mm (range 2-4mm)**  
- **Evaluating extent of degenerative disease**  
- **Good for quantifying degree of carpal height/collapse**  
  - Carpal height ratio **<0.5** is abnormal  

### MRI  
- Most sensitive and specific – shows features of **AVN isolated to lunate**  
  - **Low signal on T1 and T2** diffusely throughout lunate  
  - Initially **mixed signal** may be present  

### Bone Scan  
- Replaced by MRI  

### CT  
- No additional info compared to plain XR  

## Classification - Lichtmann  

### **Stage 1**  
- No XR features  
- MRI shows altered signal  

### **Stage 2**  
- Sclerotic Lunate but normal shape  

### **Stage 3**  
- Lunate collapse and fragmentation (decreased carpal height ratio)  
  - **3A**: No instability – scaphoid not in fixed rotation  
  - **3B**: Instability – scaphoid rotated and fixed  

### **Stage 4**  
- Pancarpal arthritis

## Presentation
- May be asymptomatic incidental finding or triggered by new trauma  
- Young adult  
- **Non-specific pain, decreased ROM, grip strength**  

## Management Principles
- **Goals depend on stage of disease and symptoms**  

### **Stage 1**  
- **Splint, NSAIDs, activity modification, and monitor**  
- May or may not work  

### **Stage 2 to Stage 3A**  
- **Aim: Prevent carpal collapse and instability**  
- **Core decompression of radius**  
  - Stimulates increased blood flow to lunate  
  - Does not alter loading or prevent collapse  

#### **If patient has negative ulna variance**  
- **Joint Levelling Procedures**  
  - **Radial shortening, ulna lengthening**  
- **Radial Shortening Osteotomy**  
  - **4mm shortening** decreases radio-lunate load **40%**  
  - Aim for **neutral or 1mm +ve variance**  

#### **If patient has neutral or positive ulna variance**  
- **Consider radial core decompression if Stage 2**  
- **Capitate Shortening or Capito-Hamate Fusion**  
  - Better for **Stage 3A**  
  - Unloads lunate  
- **STT Fusion or 4 Corner Fusion** are also options  

#### **Vascularised Bone Grafting of Lunate**  
- Used successfully in **Grade 2-3A**  
- **Best results in Grade 2** – pre-collapse  
  - Controversial in Grade 3A  
- **4-5 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery** is preferred  

### **Stage 3B**  
- **Prevent onset of pancarpal arthritis**  
- **Limited fusion**  

#### **STT Fusion**  
- Corrects **DISI** and allows loading through scaphoid  
- Offloads lunate and limits development of arthritis  

#### **4 Corner Fusion**  
- Offloads carpus but includes diseased lunate in fusion  

#### **PRC and Wrist Fusion**  
- Also reasonable options  

### **Stage 4**  
- **Salvage Procedures**  

#### **PRC (Proximal Row Carpectomy)**  
- Better for **older, lower-demand patients**  
- **Not possible if capitate arthritic or collapsed**  
  - Arthritis will persist after PRC  

#### **Total Wrist Fusion**  
- Better for **young, heavy wrist users**
