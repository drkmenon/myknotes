## Definitions
### CRPS Type 1
- Diffuse abnormal reaction to a noxious event or immobilization leading to pain, vasomotor changes, and joint stiffness
- More relevant to Orthopaedic Surgery

### CRPS Type 2
- Causalgia – initiated by injury or affliction of a particular nerve

## Risk Factors
- Females
- Wrist fractures
- 40-50 years

## Pathophysiology
- Tissue trauma stimulates mast cells to release tryptase
- Immobilization causes release and accumulation of free radicals
- Constrictive bandages exacerbate edema formation
- Genetic predisposition

## Clinical Features - **STAMPP**
- **Sensory**: Hyperesthesia, Hyperalgesia, Allodynia  
- **Trophic**: Hair thinning, sweating, brittle nails, osteopenia  
- **Autonomic**: Edema, temperature asymmetry, mottled appearance  
- **Motor**: Poor ROM, weakness  
- **Pain**: Disproportionate, constant, burning, poorly defined  
- **Psyche**: Associated depression – cause or effect?  

## Biphasic Condition
- Initially characterized by **hot, edematous skin**
- Later progresses to **mottled, cool skin with trophic changes**

## Natural History
- May resolve with treatment
- If left untreated, can worsen and lead to **permanent disability**

## Diagnosis
### Clinical
- Primarily a **clinical diagnosis**
- High index of suspicion required
- Rule out **underlying nerve injury (CRPS Type 2)**
- CRPS will almost always show **some radiographic changes**

### Investigations
- **X-ray**: Diffuse osteopenia (late feature)
- **Bone scan**:  
  - Early stages: **Hot uptake**  
  - Late stages: **May be normal**

## Management
### **Multidisciplinary Approach**
#### **Prevention**
- Awareness of the condition
- **Vitamin C** (Zollinger et al JBJS 2010 RCT)
- Early **ROM exercises**
- **Elevation**
- Early recognition

#### **Remove Perpetuating Stimuli**
- Casts, splints, or immobilization

#### **Referral to Specialists**
- **Hand Therapy** (Most important part of treatment)
  - Desensitization
  - Mirror therapy
  - TENS
  - Acupuncture
  - Splinting
  - ROM exercises
  - Counseling & Support
  - Massage
  - Hot-cold therapy
  - Functional restoration

- **Pain Clinic**
  - TENS
  - Acupuncture
  - Pharmacologic sympathetic blockades
  - Spinal cord stimulation

#### **Medications**
- **Tricyclics** (e.g., Amitriptyline – beware side effects)
- **Anti-convulsants** (e.g., Gabapentin)
- **Vitamin C** (Prophylactic action by reducing free radicals)

### **Surgical Management**
- Only if a **clear inciting issue** exists (e.g., nerve compression, neuroma)
- **Sympathectomy is unreliable**
- **Surgery generally worsens CRPS** and should be avoided

## **Overall Approach**
- **Multidisciplinary**: Therapy, counseling, pharmacology
- **Multimodal treatment** for best outcomes
