## **Overview**  
- Benign fibroproliferative disease affecting the palmar fascia  

## **Risk Factors**  
1. Male (up to 10:1)  
2. Northern European (Viking) origin  
3. Alcohol  
4. Smoking  
5. Family history  
6. Manual work  
7. Diabetes  
8. Anti-Epileptic drugs  

## **Aetiology**  
- Overriding genetic predisposition  
- Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance  

### **Contributory Theories**  
1. **Intrinsic**  
   - Metaplasia of native fascia  
2. **Extrinsic**  
   - Subdermal origin which attaches to and involves fascia  
3. **Free Radical Theory (more in vogue)**  
   - Free radicals present in hypoxic tissues (diabetics, smokers, alcoholics, manual laborers)  
   - Cause cytokine release (PDGF, TNF-b, etc.)  
   - Cytokines induce transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts  

## **Histopathology**  
- Type 3 collagen  
- Myofibroblasts  
- Cytokine mediated (TNF; Fibroblast growth factor)  

## **Pathologic Stages**  
1. **Proliferative Stage**  
   - Nodule & pit formation  
   - Large myofibroblasts dominate  
2. **Involutional Stage**  
   - Cells align in the line of digits  
   - Ratio of type 3 to type 1 collagen increases  
3. **Residual Stage**  
   - Resultant scar-like cords  
   - Myofibroblast numbers decrease, leaving fibrocytes  

## **Dupuytren’s Diathesis**  
- Severe Dupuytren’s characterized by:  
  1. Strong family history  
  2. Affliction of radial digits (thumb and index)  
  3. Ectopic disease (penis - Peyronie’s, feet - Ledderhose)  
  4. Garrod’s pads  
  5. Bilateral disease  
  6. Young presentation  

## **Order of Digits Affected**  
- **Ring > Little > Middle > Thumb > Index**  

## **Normal Anatomical Structures**  
- **Bands are normal, cords are abnormal**  

### **Palmar Fascia**  
- Continuation of forearm fascia and Palmaris longus  
- Function: Anchor skin and improve grip  

### **Key Ligaments & Bands**  
- **Pre-tendinous Band**: Ends at distal palmar crease, in line with digits  
- **Spiral Bands**: Bifurcation of pre-tendinous bands, lateral to digits  
- **Lateral Digital Sheet**: Lies lateral to NV bundles in digits  
- **Grayson’s Ligament (Ground)**: Lies volar (towards ground) to NV bundle  
- **Cleland’s Ligament**: Lies dorsal to NV bundle  
- **Vertical Fibres**: Between palmar fascia and skin  
- **Natatory Ligament**: Located in web spaces  
- **Scoog’s Fibres**: Transverse fibres between NV bundles and palmar fascia  
  - Up to distal crease level  
  - Important in revision surgery (superficial dissection is always safe)  

## **Pathologic Anatomy**  

### **Pits/Nodules**  
- Precursors of cord formation  
- Lie over pre-tendinous bands  
- Related to vertical fibres that anchor the skin  

### **Cords & Contractures**  
1. **Pre-tendinous Cord**  
   - Most commonly involved band causing MCPJ contracture  
   - Responsible for MCPJ contracture along with natatory cord  
2. **Central Cord**  
   - Extension of the pre-tendinous cord into the digit  
   - No NV displacement  
3. **Spiral Cord**  
   - NV bundle spirals around it and is displaced  
4. **Lateral Cord**  
   - From lateral digital sheet  
   - Displaces NV bundle medially (uncommon)  
5. **Natatory Cord**  
   - From natatory ligament  
   - Must be excised to complete correction at MCPJ level  
6. **Retrovascular Cord**  
   - Rare dorsal cord extending to DIPJ causing hyperextension  
7. **Abductor Digiti Minimi Cord**  
   - Only in little finger, displaces NV bundle medially  
8. **Commissural Cord**  
   - 1st web space cord  

## **Diagnosis**  

### **History**  
- Risk factors  
- Degree of disability  
- Previous surgery  
- Features of Dupuytren’s diathesis  
- Presence of pain (pain is unusual, beware if present)  

### **Examination**  
- Quantify deformity  
  - Measure PIPJ with MCPJ flexed (cord crosses both joints)  
  - Measure MCPJ with PIPJ flexed  
- Define cords  
- Skin quality  
- Previous scars  
- **Must do Digital Allen’s test in severe deformities pre-operatively**  

### **Differential Diagnosis**  
- **Epithelioid Sarcoma**: Rare, aggressive, not confined to fascia  
- **Subcutaneous Lesions**: GCT, dermoid cysts, trigger finger, etc.  
- **Primary Joint Contracture**  

## **Surgical Planning**  
- **Considerations**  
  - Deformity correction feasibility  
  - Skin problems  
  - NV structure displacement  
  - Functional aims of the patient  

## **Management**  

### **Non-Operative**  
- **Splinting & Steroid injections not effective**  
- Mild disease should be managed non-operatively as recurrence is inevitable  

### **Collagenase Injection (Xiaflex)**  
- Injection into the cord  
- MUA the following day if no spontaneous rupture occurs  
- Selectively attacks type 3 collagen  
- **Approved by NICE**  
- **CORD 1 Trial (NEJM RCT)**: Beneficial for MCPJ  
- **CORD 2 Trial**: Examined PIPJ (data pending)  
- **Limitations**: Expensive, long-term results unknown (>3 years)  

### **Operative Indications**  
- MCPJ deformity >30°  
- PIPJ deformity >15°  
- Symptomatic patient  

### **Markers of Poor Outcome/Recurrence**  
- Significant PIPJ deformity (collateral ligament & volar plate contracture)  
- Young patient (more aggressive disease, longer recurrence window)  
- Dupuytren’s diathesis  
- Revision surgery  

### **Operative Options**  

#### **Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy**  
- Good for pre-tendinous cords  
- Risk of NV bundle displacement in spiral/lateral cords  
- Higher recurrence, but minimal invasiveness  

#### **Skin Incisions**  
- **Brunner’s Incision** (>60° angles)  
- **Straight with Z-plasties** (60° angle = 75% more length)  
- **Open Palm (McCash)**: Leaves large skin defects open  

#### **Fasciectomy**  
1. **Partial/Regional Fasciectomy**  
   - Workhorse procedure, good correction but eventual recurrence  
   - May require open wound management or grafting  
2. **Segmental Fasciectomy**  
   - Cords divided at multiple levels  
   - Lower morbidity, higher recurrence  
   - Reserved for elderly with low correction aims  
3. **Radical Fasciectomy**  
   - Rarely used, aims for total fascia excision  
   - Recurrence still occurs  

#### **Dermofasciectomy**  
- **For revision cases or severe primary disease**  
- Excision of diseased tissue with midlateral incisions  
- **Full-thickness skin graft from cubital fossa**  
- **Recurrence rate 10% (low)**  

## **Post-Op Protocol**  
- **Plaster splinting with fingers straight**  
- **Follow-up in 1 week**: Wound check & splinting  
- **Splinting for 6 weeks**  
  - Flexion exercises to prevent stiffness  
  - Night splinting up to 6 months  

## **Salvage Surgery**  
- **Amputation**: Severe recurrent disease, low-demand patient  
- **Corrective Arthrodesis**: Recurrent disease, poor soft tissues  

## **Complications**  
- **Intraoperative**: NV damage, vascular spasm  
- **Postoperative**: CRPS, haematoma, wound breakdown, infection, recurrence, loss of flexion
