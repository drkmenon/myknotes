## Finger Zones

### Zone 1

-   Contains only FDP

### Zone 2

-   From origin of sheath (MCPJ – distal palmar crease) to middle phalanx
-   Contains both FDS and FDP within a tight non-distensible sheath
-   Often both tendons are lacerated
-   Worst prognosis

### Zone 3

-   Between carpal tunnel and origin of synovial sheath (distal palm crease)
-   Contain the origin of the lumbricals from FDP
-   Lumbrical muscle tends to be injured

### Zone 4

-   Carpal tunnel – contains 9 tendons and median nerve

### Zone 5

-   Proximal to carpal tunnel
-   Best prognosis for repair

## Thumb Zones

-   Only one tendon \> FPL - zones are similar in pattern

| Zone       | Location                       |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Zone 1     | Distal insertion of FPL        |
| Zone 2     | Over proximal phalanx and MCPJ |
| Zone 3     | Over thenar muscles            |
| Zone 4 & 5 | Same as for fingers            |

## Flexor Tendons

-   Flexors are all long, extrinsic tendons – 6 in total
    -   No contribution from intrinsics
-   **Wrist Flexors:** FCR, PL, FCU
-   **Digital Flexors:** FDP, FDS, FPL
    -   Little finger FDS absent in 20% of people
    -   Long to little fingers FDP have common muscle belly
    -   Index finger has its own FDP belly
-   **Testing FDS**
    -   To test FDS to fingers, flex PIPJ with other fingers extended (neutralizes FDP)
    -   To test FDS in the index separately, ask for a pincer grip with DIPJ hyperextended
    -   If FDS is absent, only an "OK" sign is possible

## Tendon Nutrition

-   Flexors are mainly **intrasynovial** tendons
-   Lie within a fibro-osseous sheath with a **double-layer synovium**
-   No **paratenon** (unlike extensors)
-   **Sheath Entry Points:**
    -   Index, middle, ring fingers enter at **MC neck level**
    -   Thumb and little finger have **synovial sheath in whole palm**
-   **2 Modes of Nutrition:**
    1.  **Longitudinal vessels** from phalanges enter via **vinculae system**
        -   Vincula longus and brevis per tendon
        -   Tendon relatively avascular on palmar surface
    2.  **Passive diffusion from synovial fluid (imbibition)**
        -   Relies on motion

## Structure

-   **FDS initially volar to FDP** in forearm and palm
-   **FDS splits and encircles FDP** over P1 (Camper's chiasm)
-   **FDS reforms dorsal to FDP and attaches to P2**
-   In **Zone 2**, FDS and FDP glide over each other → **high adhesion risk**
-   **Blood Supply via Vinculae:**
    -   VBP (Vinculum Brevis Profundus)
    -   VBS (Vinculum Brevis Superficialis)
    -   VLP (Vinculum Longus Profundus)
    -   VLS (Vinculum Longus Superficialis)

## Lumbricals

-   **4 Lumbricals in total**
-   Arise from **FDP** proximal to MCPJ in Zone 3
-   **Radial lumbricals**: single-headed
-   **Ulnar lumbricals**: two-headed
-   **Insertion:**
    -   Radial aspect of extensor mechanism
    -   Pass dorsally and insert distal to PIPJ
    -   Contribute to **extensor hood & lateral bands**
    -   **Function:** Extend PIPJ & Flex MCPJ

## Pulley System

-   **Fibro-osseous tendon sheath anchored dorsally to bone**
-   **Pulley Types:**
    -   **Annular (A1-5):** Thick and fibrous (prevent bowstringing)
    -   **Cruciate (C1-3):** Flimsy, allow flexibility
-   **Odd-numbered pulleys arise from volar plate**
-   **Even-numbered pulleys arise from periosteum**
    -   **A2 and A4 are most important** for function
-   **Thumb Pulleys:**
    -   **2 Annular (A1 & A2) and 1 Oblique**
    -   **Oblique Pulley:** Runs **ulnar-proximal to radial-distal** on P1
    -   **Oblique pulley is critical for stability**

## Prognosis for Flexor Tendon Repair

-   **Order from best to worst:** Zone 5 \> Zone 4 \> Zone 3 \> Zone 1 \> Zone 2
-   **Prognosis Factors:**
    -   Ease of access for repair
    -   Room for tendons to glide
    -   Less room = **higher adhesion risk** → Worse prognosis
-   **Zone 2 has worst prognosis:**
    -   Tight sheath with FDS & FDP close together
    -   High adhesion risk
-   **Zone 3 Complications:**
    -   Lumbrical repair or scarring → **Intrinsic plus hand deformity**
    -   Leads to **MCP flexion contracture and restricted IPJ flexion**
-   **Zone 5 has best prognosis:**
    -   No enclosing sheath → **free-moving tendons**
