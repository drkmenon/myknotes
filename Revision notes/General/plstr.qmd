## Plaster of Paris

### History
- A house in Paris on a gypsium deposit burned down in the 1800s.  
- A gypsium mine still exists near Montmartre in Paris.  
- Rain falling on the remains revealed that footprints hardened in the material.  
- Initially used in industry and for coating walls.  
- First used by Mathyson of the Dutch military in 1852 to make splints from cotton bandages.  

### Current Form
- A muslin roll stiffened by starch or dextrose and impregnated with a hemihydrate of calcium sulphate.  
- **Chemical Formula**: CaSO₄·2H₂O (Gypsium).  
- On addition of water, calcium sulphate crystallizes.  
- **Setting Time**:  
  - Sets in 5-10 minutes.  
  - Fully hardens in 72 hours when it becomes completely anhydrous.  

### Advantages
- Cheap.  
- Mouldable.  
- No adverse allergic reactions.  
- More expansile in case of swelling.  

### Disadvantages
- Heavy.  
- Partially radio-opaque.  
- Not waterproof.  
- Weaker than fibreglass.
