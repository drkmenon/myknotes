## Transfusion Reactions

### Allergic Reaction
- **Most common.**  
- Occurs towards the end of a transfusion.  
- **Management:**  
  - Settles spontaneously.  
  - Supportive medical treatment.  

### Febrile Reaction
- Occurs after the first **100 ml.**  
- **Cause:** Antibody formation against foreign RBCs.  
- **Management:**  
  - Stop transfusion.  
  - Treat fever supportively.  

### Haemolytic Reaction
- **Most severe.**  
- Occurs early in the transfusion.  
- **Symptoms:**  
  - Chest tightness.  
  - Flank pain.  
  - Tachycardia.  
  - Fever and chills.  
- **Management:**  
  - Stop transfusion immediately.  
  - Administer IV fluids.  
  - Perform coagulation screening.  
  - Transfer to ICU for monitoring.

## Transfusion Infection Transmission Risks
- **Hepatitis C:** 1 in 2 million (rarest).  
- **Hepatitis B:** 1 in 200,000.  
- **CMV:**  
  - Most common.  
  - Carried by 70% of donors.  
  - Clinically irrelevant.  
- **HIV:** 1 in 1.2 million.

## Alternatives to Blood Transfusion

### Autologous Deposition
- **Description:** Storage of autologous donated blood weeks before surgery.  
- **Indications:**  
  - Anticipated significant blood loss during surgery.  
  - Patient preference.  
- **Contraindications:**  
  - Low Hb (<11).  
  - Coronary artery disease.  
  - Low haematocrit (<33%).  
- Hepatitis C-containing blood can be transfused back to the patient.  

### Cell Saver
- **Description:** Collection, washing, and re-transfusion of blood intra-operatively.  
- **Requirements:**  
  - Blood loss >1 unit expected.  
  - Minimum of 400 ml blood loss needed to produce 1 unit.  
  - Maximum usage time: 4 hours.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Blood is collected and passed through a filter.  
  2. Washed to remove cytokines and debris (also removes clotting factors and platelets).  
  3. Re-transfused into the patient.  
- **Disadvantage:**  
  - Sub-standard blood quality.  
  - Residual cytokines may cause SIRS, TRALI, etc.  

### Autotransfusion
- **Description:** Direct re-introduction of lost blood back into the bloodstream.  
- **Requirements:**  
  - Must begin within **6 hours of blood loss** to avoid transfusion reaction.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Contains clotting factors and platelets.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Risk of reactions due to unremoved cytokines and debris.  
  - May not be of optimal quality.

## Blood Product Storage

| **Product**       | **Storage Duration** | **Temperature** |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Whole Blood        | 24 hours            | Room Temperature |
| Packed Red Cells   | 35 days             | 4°C             |
| Platelets          | 5 days              | Room Temperature |
| Cryoprecipitate    | 12 months           | -25°C           |

## Massive Transfusion Protocols

### Definition
- **Massive Transfusion:**  
  - Transfusion of >4 units of blood in 1 hour.  
- **Statistics:**  
  - Leading cause of preventable trauma deaths (39%).  
  - 2% of trauma victims require massive transfusion.  
- **Main Complication:** Post-transfusion coagulopathy.  

### Global Recommendations
- **Debra L. Malone, Journal of Trauma (2006):**  
  - Equivalent use of packed cells and platelets.  
  - Early use of platelets and FFP reduces coagulopathy.  
  - Early use of FFP reduces mortality.  

### Practical Guidelines
- **Identify at-risk patients based on:**  
  - Injury mechanism.  
  - Biochemical parameters:  
    - HR > 100.  
    - Acidosis.  
    - Raised lactate.  
    - Poor response to fluid resuscitation.  

- **Goals:**  
  - Normothermia.  
  - Urine output ≥ 35 ml/hr.  
  - Hb ≥ 10 g/dL.  
  - PT & APTT ratio < 1.5.  
  - Platelets > 100,000.  
  - Normal lactate.  

### General Protocol
- Use a **1:1 ratio of FFP and RBC.**  
- Start with **4 units of each.**  
- Add platelets for every **4 units** given after the first batch.
