## Definition
- Use of high-frequency electrical current to produce heat.  
- Utilizes an alternating current (AC).  

---

## Current Strength
- **Mains Electricity**: 50 Hz  
  - Causes intense nerve and muscle activation.  
- **Diathermy**: 300 KHz â€“ 3 MHz  
  - Stronger current avoids muscle and nerve activation.

## Types of Diathermy

### Monopolar Diathermy
- **Active Electrode**: Tip of the instrument.  
- **Indifferent Electrode**: Plate placed on the patient.  
- **Current Flow**: Passes through the patient.  
- **Heat Generation**:  
  - Intense heat at the instrument tip.  
  - Minimal heat at the plate.  
- **Burn Prevention**:  
  - Use a large surface area plate.  
  - Place over a large muscle mass.

### Cutting Diathermy
- Continuous current is used.  
- **Waveform**: Sinusoidal.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Tissue is vaporized.  
  - No coagulation occurs.  

---

### Coagulation Diathermy
- Intermittent current is used, allowing time for coagulation to occur.  
- **Waveform**: Square.  
- **Frequency**: 50 per second (10% of continuous waveform).  
- **Effect**:  
  - More surrounding tissue damage if used for cutting.  

---

### Bipolar Diathermy
- **Current Path**: Passes between the tips of the instrument, not through the patient.  
- **Safety**:  
  - Safe for use in patients with pacemakers.  
  - Points of forceps must be separated for current to pass.

## Risks and Complications of Diathermy
1. **Pacemaker Interference**: Use bipolar diathermy.  
2. **Arcing**: Can occur with metal implants (place plate away from metal).  
3. **Flammable Skin Prep**:  
   - Burns can occur if pooling or soaking of drapes happens.  
4. **Improper Plate Application**:  
   - Concentrates current, leading to burns.
