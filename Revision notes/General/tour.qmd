## Types of Tourniquets
1. **Pneumatic**:
   - Automatic: More accurate.
   - Manual.
2. **Non-Pneumatic**:
   - E.g., for finger surgery.

---

## Contra-indications to Tourniquet Use
1. **Absolute**:
   - Severe crush injuries.
   - Compartment syndrome.
2. **Relative**:
   - Sickle cell disease.
   - Peripheral vascular disease.

---

## Nerve Injury Related to Tourniquet Use
- **Cause**: Direct compression neuropraxia at the edge of the cuff. 
  - The central part of the cuff is spared.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Displacement of the node of Ranvier from its normal relation to the Schwann cell.
  - Causes stretching of the myelin sheath.
  - **Not due to ischaemic injury to nerves**.

---

## Cuff Design and Pressures
- **Pressures**:
  - Highest at the center of the cuff where skin pressure is 95% of the cuff pressure.
  - Higher cuff pressure correlates to higher tissue pressure.
  - Tissue pressures fall as limb circumference increases.
  - Only a 2% decrease in pressure from the surface to the deepest tissues.
- **Cuff Width**:
  - Narrower cuffs require higher occlusion pressure for the same limb circumference.
  - **Wider cuffs** should be used in larger limbs to reduce the risk of neurological injury.

---

## Limb Occlusion Pressures (LOP)
- Pressure required to occlude arterial flow distal to the cuff.
- **Traditional Recommendations**:
  - Add **50–75 mmHg** to the systolic pressure for the upper limb.
  - Double the systolic pressure for the lower limb.
- **More Accurate Method**:
  1. Gradually increase tourniquet pressure until the distal pulse is lost.
  2. Adjust:
     - Add **40 mmHg** for occlusion pressures <130 mmHg.
     - Add **60 mmHg** for occlusion pressures <190 mmHg.
     - Add **80 mmHg** for occlusion pressures >190 mmHg.
  - This method results in significantly lower tourniquet pressures.

---

## Limb Exanguination
- **More effective than elevation alone**.
- **Contraindications**:
  - Infection.
  - Metastatic disease.
  - Venous thrombosis.

---

## Limb Protection
- Studies show padding under the cuff reduces skin injuries.
- **Two-layer elastic stockinette** is superior to Velband padding.

---

## Duration of Tourniquet Use
- **Recommended**: 2 hours (safe, especially in the upper limb).
- **No definitive unsafe time**, but:
  - Longer durations = increased risk of nerve injury and tissue ischaemia.
  - Up to 3 hours may be acceptable in the lower limb (use common sense).

---

## Complications of Tourniquet Use

### Local
- Neuropraxia.
- Muscle ischaemia and necrosis.
- Vascular injury.
- Post-release swelling and joint stiffness.
- Haematoma formation.
- Delayed recovery of muscle power.

### Systemic
- Embolism of fat and metabolites.
- Cardio-respiratory decomposition (not conclusively proven).

---

### Neuropraxia
- Resolves within 3 months.
- Affects motor and sensory functions (temperature sensation preserved).
- Pulses, skin appearance, and temperature are normal.
- **EMG findings**: Conduction block at the level of the tourniquet.

---

### Muscle Ischaemia
- Re-perfusion injury to the muscle.
- Longer tourniquet times = higher CK levels and more tissue ischaemia.
- **Tissue markers normalize** between 2 and 20 minutes after reperfusion.
- No evidence that deflating and re-inflating the tourniquet improves safety.

---

### Myonephrotic Metabolic Syndrome
- Rare, occurs in severe ischaemia.
- Features:
  - Renal failure.
  - Metabolic acidosis.
  - Myoglobinuria.
  - Hyperkalaemia.

---

## Tourniquet Deflation
- No evidence that tourniquet use increases the risk of DVT or PE after deflation.
- **Precautions**:
  - Monitor patients undergoing intramedullary procedures for sudden fat or metabolite embolism.
- **Effects of Deflation**:
  - Increases production of antithrombin 3 and Protein C, leading to increased bleeding and reduced clotting.

---

## Tourniquet Release in Total Knee Replacement (TKR)
- **Pre-closure deflation**:
  - Increases blood loss and transfusion needs.
  - Associated with increased infection risk.
- **Post-closure deflation**:
  - More likely to require return for wound washout.
- **Surgeon’s Discretion**:
  - Balance between minimizing blood loss and reducing infection risk.
