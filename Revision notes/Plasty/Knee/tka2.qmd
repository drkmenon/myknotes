## Clinical Goals
1. Achieve a knee that is:
   - Pain-free
   - Provides functional range of motion (ROM)
   - Ensures longevity
2. Achieved by:
   - Restoring correct mechanical alignment
   - Using good component design
   - Ensuring durable fixation
   - Restoring the joint line
   - Proper knee balancing

---

## Mechanical Axis
- **Femoral Anatomic vs. Mechanical Axis**:
  - The femoral anatomic axis is 6° off its mechanical axis.
- **Tibial Axis**:
  - Mechanical and anatomic axes are identical.
- **Distal Femur**:
  - In 6° valgus, allowing parallel articulation with the tibia.

---

## Surgical Techniques

### Distal Femoral Cut
- Creates the **extension gap**.
- Referenced from the femoral anatomic axis.
  - Cutting jig replicates normal 6° valgus.
  - Results in a rectangular extension gap.
- Adjustments for:
  - Very tall (<6° valgus).
  - Very short patients (>6° valgus).
  - Previous femoral deformity (pre-operative measurement required).

### AP Femoral Cut
- Determines the **flexion gap**.
- Normal tibial plateau is in 3° varus; tibial cut is perpendicular to the tibial axis.
- To create a rectangular flexion gap:
  - Posterior condyles are cut in external rotation (removing more of the MFC).
  - Cutting jigs are typically offset by 3°.

#### Referencing Options
1. **Anterior Referencing**:
   - Errors affect the posterior condyles, prioritizing PFJ space.
2. **Posterior Referencing**:
   - Errors affect the anterior space, prioritizing flexion gap.

## Joint Line Restoration
- Critical for maintaining ligament function at normal tension.
- Achieved by replacing the same amount of bone/cartilage resected.
- Elevation or distalization of the joint line can result in:
  - **Patella Baja**:
    - Limits flexion and causes patella-poly impingement.
  - **Patella Alta**:
    - Increases contact pressures in flexion, leading to pain and wear.

---

## Ligament Balancing
- Essential for correcting deformities.
- **Varus Knee**:
  - Releases are performed on the tibia (osteophytes, MCL, etc.).
  - Sequential releases of superficial MCL, avoiding complete release.
- **Valgus Knee**:
  - Releases are mainly performed on the femur (lateral capsule, ITB, LCL).
  - Severe valgus deformities may require constrained prostheses.
- **Flexion Contracture**:
  - Managed with posterior osteophyte removal, capsule release, or increased tibial slope.

---

## Balancing the PCL
- **Too tight**: Excessive rollback damages poly.
- **Too lax**: Flexion instability and reduced ROM.
- Managed by:
  - Sequential PCL recessing (1-2 mm increments).
  - Increasing posterior slope.
  - Switching to posterior-stabilized (PS) components if necessary.

## Addressing Flexion/Extension Gap Mismatches
1. Equalize flexion and extension gaps for stable tibial insert throughout ROM.
2. Rules for sagittal plane balancing:
   - Symmetric issues: Address tibia first.
   - Asymmetric issues: Address femur first.

### Common Scenarios
| **Scenario**               | **Problem**                            | **Solution**                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Flexion & Extension tight  | Tibial cut too small                  | Cut more tibia                     |
| Flexion & Extension loose  | Too much tibia cut                    | Upsize poly or augment tibia       |
| Flexion good, Extension loose | Excessive distal femur resection   | Augment distal femur or downsize femur |
| Flexion good, Extension tight | Inadequate distal femur resection  | Cut more distal femur              |
| Flexion tight, Extension good | Insufficient posterior femur resection | Downsize femur or recess/substitute PCL |
| Flexion loose, Extension good | Excessive posterior femur resection | Upsize femur AP size               |

## Patellofemoral Joint (PFJ)
### Maltracking and Failure Causes
- Common technical causes include:
  - Unequal gaps (instability/impingement).
  - Patella maltracking or overstuffing.

### Strategies for Optimal Tracking
1. Lateralize femoral component.
2. Medialize patella button.
3. Avoid internal rotation of tibia or femur.
4. Restore mechanical alignment (valgus increases Q angle).

### PFJ Pathologies
- **Patella Baja**:
  - Pre-existing or due to distal femoral cut.
  - Managed by superior button placement or anterior poly trimming.
- **Patella Alta**:
  - Caused by excessive tibial cut or lowered joint line.
  - Leads to early wear.

## TKA After Patellectomy
- Reduces quadriceps strength by ~50%.
- Post-patellectomy TKR:
  - Use PS knee (prevents anterior femoral translation).
