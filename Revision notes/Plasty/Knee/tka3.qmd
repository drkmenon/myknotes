# Patella-Femoral Arthroplasty (PFA)

## Indications
1. Isolated patellofemoral (PF) arthritis.
2. Young patients (<50 years).

## Contraindications
1. PF instability.
2. Medial or lateral compartment arthrosis.
3. High-demand patients with unrealistic expectations.
4. Inflammatory arthritis.
5. Malalignment.

## Results
1. **Appropriate Patients**:
   - 90% good outcomes at mid-term follow-up.
2. **Conversion to TKR**:
   - Outcomes may be worse compared to primary TKR.
   - Early studies (e.g., AAOS 2012) report mixed results.

# Management of Bone Deficiency in TKR

## Causes
- Bone loss may occur due to various etiologies, including degenerative changes or previous surgeries.

## Classification of Bone Defects
1. **Type 1**:
   - Small, focal defect contained within cortical rim.
2. **Type 2**:
   - Larger metaphyseal defect, still contained within cortical rim.
3. **Type 3**:
   - Uncontained metaphyseal defect with no cortical rim.

## Management Strategies
1. **Contained Defects <5 mm**:
   - Fill with cement.
2. **Larger Contained Defects**:
   - Use impacted cancellous graft.
3. **Very Large or Uncontained Defects**:
   - Structural autograft fixed with screws.
   - Cement around multiple screws.
   - Metallic augments.
4. **Critical Considerations**:
   - Ensure correct alignment to avoid stress on grafts.
   - For significant grafting, use stems to dissipate stress away from the graft.

# Wound Closure

## Key Steps
1. Perform closure in **flexion**:
   - Ensures patella tracking.
   - Avoids soft tissue restriction impacting ROM.
2. Use **sub-cuticular sutures**:
   - Minimizes wound ooze.

# Use of Drains

## Observations
1. No significant difference in wound infection rates.
2. **With Drains**:
   - Increased risk of transfusions.
3. **Without Drains**:
   - Requires more dressing changes and padding but no increase in infection rates.
   - **Note**: Avoiding wound drainage is preferable to minimize infection risk.

# Use of Navigation in TKR

## Benefits
1. Ideal for managing pre-operative femoral or tibial deformities.
2. Improves consistency in recreating correct mechanical axes in primary TKR.

## Limitations
- Improved alignment has not yet been directly correlated with better clinical outcomes.

# Custom Cutting Blocks

## Overview
1. Useful for challenging primary or revision knees.
2. Process:
   - Pre-operative MRI or CT used for templating.
   - Cutting blocks are custom-made for patient anatomy.
