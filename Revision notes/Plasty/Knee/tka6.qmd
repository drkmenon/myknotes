## Most Important Factor:
- Accurate diagnosis of the cause of failure and a clear strategy for revision.

## Causes of Failure:
1. Osteolysis
2. Aseptic Loosening
3. Catastrophic Polyethylene (PE) Failure
4. Patella Pain
5. Instability
6. Fracture
7. Infection
8. Stiffness
9. Undiagnosed (Mystery Knee)

### **Osteolysis**
- Less common in TKR.
- **Wear mode** in TKR: subsurface delamination.
- **Delamination** produces larger particles compared to abrasive wear, which are more biologically active.
- When osteolysis occurs in TKR, it tends to be **expansile**.

### **Aseptic Loosening**
- Less common cause than wear.
- **Tibia** is more commonly affected than the femur.
- **Uncemented designs** are prone to early loosening but become equal thereafter.
- May be related to osteolysis but not always.
- **Malalignment** (especially varus) predisposes to loosening.
- **Diagnosis**: 
  - New onset pain (e.g., start-up, weight-bearing, knee motion).
  - Subsidence of tibia.
  - Changes in tibial position or rotation.
  - Radiolucent lines that progress in size or are continuous.
  - Stiffness.

---

### **Stiffness**
- Can be **global** (failure to extend or flex).
- **Arthrofibrosis** (scarring, especially in medial and lateral recesses) causes global stiffness.
- Loss of extension: Often due to hamstring overactivity or overstuffing of the extension gap.
- Loss of flexion: Due to quadriceps contracture or overstuffing of the flexion gap.
- **Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA)** should be performed within 6 weeks; overstuffing requires revision.

---

### **Instability**
- Types: **Mediolateral**, **patella**, and **flexion instability**.
  - **Mediolateral Instability**: Caused by collateral ligament injury, intra- or post-operatively.
  - **Flexion Instability**: Typically, the knee sits backward due to absence of ACL. Worse with tight or strong hamstrings. 
    - Paradoxical anterior femoral translation instead of rollback.
  - **Patella Instability**: Usually due to component malrotation.

---

### **Evaluating the Painful Knee**
- History, imaging, and blood tests are essential.
- **Three broad causes**:
  1. **Infection/inflammation**
  2. **Neurogenic**
  3. **Mechanical**
- **Mechanical Causes**: 
  - **Patella**: Clunk syndrome (scar tissue impinging against the polyethylene post in a PS knee).
  - **Flexion Instability**: Associated with anterior translation of femur in CR knees.
  - **Malalignment**: Varus causes loosening; valgus causes instability.

---

### **Assessment of Bone Loss**
- Pre-operative imaging may **underestimate** bone loss.
- **CT scan** and intra-operative assessment are better.
- Factors: Size, location, contained or uncontained defects, and potential blood supply to the bone.
- **Surgical Principles**: Diagnosis, exposure, bone loss, instability, joint line height.

---

### **Approach & Exposure**
- In multiply operated knees, use the most **lateral incision** to avoid anterior skin necrosis.
- **Medial Parapatellar approach** is commonly used.
- **Extensile measures**: Rectus snip, tibial tubercle osteotomy (avoided if possible).

---

### **Bone Loss Management**
- Small defects: Fill with **cement**.
- Larger defects: Use **particulate bone graft**.
- **Big defects**: Use **metallic augments**, **allografts**, or **endoprostheses**.
- **Uncontained defects**: Likely require **metallic augments**.
- **Stem use**: Stems help dissipate stress at the bone-implant interface, preventing rapid loosening.
  - Indicated for instability, protecting bone graft, and dubious metaphyseal fixation.

---

### **Levels of Constraint**
- **Unconstrained CR or PS**: Rare for TKR revision.
- **Semi-Constrained PS**: Wider, taller post, effective for medio-lateral instability but risks post wear.
- **Fully Constrained Fixed or Rotating Hinge**: Used for very unstable knees with no collateral competence.
  - Requires more bone resection.
  - Prevents hyperextension.

---

### **Implant Constraints**
- **Increased constraint** is counteracted by:
  - **Rotating platform** or **rotating hinge**.
  - **Stemmed implants** to dissipate stresses.
