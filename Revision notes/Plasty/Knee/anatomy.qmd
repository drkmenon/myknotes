# Anatomy and Biomechanics of the Knee

## Anatomy

- **Knee**: A condylar joint.  
- **Patellofemoral Joint**: A saddle joint.

### Tibia
- 7–10° posterior slope.
- 3° varus to the anatomic axis.
- Lateral plateau higher than medial.
- Lateral plateau convex; medial plateau concave.
- Plateaus separated by the intercondylar eminence.
- Spinous processes arise from the intercondylar eminence.
- Gerdy’s tubercle: Attachment of the ITB.

### Femur
- Medial femoral condyle (MFC) is larger and more distal.
- Lateral femoral condyle (LFC) is wider.
- Adductor tubercle is the proximal origin of MCL and MPFL, located just proximal to the medial epicondyle.
- PCL is on the medial wall of the notch; ACL is on the lateral wall.
- Just distal to the LFC’s medial edge lies the sulcus terminalis.

### Patella
- Thickest articular cartilage in the body.
- Three facets:
  - Medial, Lateral, and Odd Facet (small and far medial).
  - Medial and lateral facets separated by a longitudinal ridge; the lateral facet is usually larger.
- Accessory patella typically found superior-laterally.

#### Wiberg Classification of Patella Morphology
1. **Type 1**: Medial and lateral facets equal; ridge central.
2. **Type 2**: Medial facet smaller; ridge medialized (most common).
3. **Type 3**: Medial facet tiny and far medialized, rendering the ridge almost absent.

### Trochlea
- Lateral ridge is higher than the medial ridge (may be dysplastic).
- **Dejour Index**: Used for classification.

### Fibula
- Does not contribute to the knee joint.
- Articulates with the lateral tibia at the fibular notch.
- Fibular styloid process: Attachment of LCL and biceps tendon.
- Common peroneal nerve runs beneath the biceps and around the fibular neck.

### Vascular Anatomy
- Arterial anastomosis from femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries:
  - Femoral artery → Popliteal artery → Anterior and Posterior tibial arteries.
- Branches:
  - **Superior Geniculate (medial and lateral)**: Popliteal.
  - **Inferior Geniculate (medial and lateral)**: Popliteal.
  - **Middle Geniculate**: Popliteal.
  - **Descending Geniculate**: Femoral.
  - **Anterior Tibial Recurrent Arteries**: Tibial.
- Inferior geniculates pass deep to their respective collateral ligaments.

#### Patella Blood Supply
- Geniculate anastomosis and anterior recurrent tibial artery.
- Blood enters the patella in the lower two-thirds.

### Nerve Anatomy
- Sensory nerves:
  - **Femoral (L2–L4)**, **Obturator (L2–L4)**, and **Sciatic (L4–S2)**.
- Important nerves:
  - **Posterior Articular Nerve**: Branch of the posterior tibial nerve (intra-articular structures).
  - **Infra-patella Branch of Saphenous Nerve**: Supplies skin over the anterior knee and tibia.

### Ligaments
- Refer to the section on ligament injuries.

### Extensor Mechanism
- **Quadriceps Tendon**:
  - Rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis.
- Medial and lateral retinaculae extend from the quadriceps.
- Patellofemoral ligaments are thickenings of the retinaculum.
- MPFL stabilizes the patella and attaches to the adductor tubercle.

### Meniscus
- Medial: C-shaped; lateral: nearly circular.
- Lateral meniscus is more mobile (posterolaterally not attached at the popliteal hiatus).
- Connected to the capsule by coronary ligaments (more on the medial meniscus).
- Menisci are connected anteriorly by the intermeniscal ligament.
- **Meniscofemoral Ligaments**:
  - Humphrey’s (anterior) and Wrisberg’s (posterior) ligaments.
  - Arise from the lateral meniscus, pass around the PCL, and attach to the femur.
  - Alphabetical order: Humphrey (H) → PCL → Wrisberg (W).

## Biomechanics

### Gait
- Knee functions during gait:
  - Flexes to decrease impact at initial contact.
  - Extends in mid-stance for leg stabilization.
  - Flexes in the initial swing for foot clearance.

#### Gait Abnormalities
- **Quads Avoidance Gait**:
  - Weak quads or ACL deficiency.
  - Compensatory forward leaning to prevent knee buckling.
- **Fixed Flexion Deformity (FFD)**:
  - Difficulty in stance; compensatory mechanisms occur in the opposite leg.

### Joint Reaction Forces
- Tibiofemoral joint: 3× body weight during walking, 4× on stairs.
- Patellofemoral joint: 3× body weight on stairs, 7× during deep squats.

### Ligament Kinematics
- Knee acts as a 4-bar linkage enabling rolling and sliding motion.
- ACL and PCL cross-over point: Center of axis of rotation (COR).
- ACL:
  - AM bundle tight in flexion; PL bundle tight in extension.
  - Ultimate tensile strength: 2000N.
- PCL:
  - Opposite bundle behavior; PM bundle tight in extension.
  - Stronger than ACL (UTN: 2500N).

### Meniscus Biomechanics
- Anisotropic properties (load-dependent behavior).
- Dissipates 50% of the load in extension, 75% in flexion.
- Meniscectomy increases articular contact pressure proportionally.

### Articular Cartilage
- Biphasic material (70% water content).
- Withstands repetitive loading via a strong proteoglycan matrix.
- Disuse or pathological loading damages cartilage integrity.
