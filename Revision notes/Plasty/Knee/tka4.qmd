# Wear in Total Knee Replacement (TKR)

## Catastrophic Wear vs. Long-Term Wear
- **Catastrophic Wear**: Different from long-term submicron wear particles.
- Influenced by various factors:
  1. Polyethylene (PE) thickness.
  2. PE manufacturing.
  3. PE sterilization.
  4. Articular geometry.
  5. Sagittal plane kinematics.

## PE Thickness
- Minimum acceptable thickness: **8mm**.
- Thinner polyethylene has insufficient yield strength.
- Includes metal tray thickness in measurement.

## Articular Geometry
- **Flatter Polyethylene**:
  - Decreases congruency, increasing contact pressure.
  - Accelerates wear (e.g., edge loading, fatigue failure).
- Better designs prioritize higher congruency and more surface area contact.

## Sagittal Plane Kinematics
- **Without ACL rollback**:
  - Includes sliding, which leads to subsurface wear and cracks in PE.
- **New designs**:
  - Increased articular congruency reduces sliding.
  - Flexion achieved through increased slope, posterior center of rotation (COR), or posterior stabilized (PS) designs.

## PE Sterilization
- **Oxidized PE** is weaker.
- Best sterilized with **inert gas** irradiation (prevents free radical oxidation).
- **Storage**: In a vacuum with a shelf life of <2 years.
- Avoid using highly cross-linked polyethylene in TKR due to its vulnerability to fatigue wear.

## PE Manufacturing
- **Best Method**: Direct compression molding.
- **Avoid RAM bar extruded PE** due to inconsistent quality.
- **Subsurface white band** indicates vulnerability to fatigue failure and delamination.

# Total Knee Replacement in Specific Situations

## Previous High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)
### Challenges:
1. **Multiple Scars**:
   - Prefer MPP approach or lateral incisions for easier access.
2. **Joint Line**:
   - **Patella Baja** common; use cuts that lower the joint line.
3. **Rotational Malalignment**:
   - Do not rely on IM referencing.
4. **Ligament Balance**:
   - More challenging post-HTO; use PCL substituting implants.

## Previous Patellectomy
- **Challenges**:
  - Reduced **quadriceps strength** (up to 50%).
  - Decreased flexion and no rollback of the femur relative to tibia.
  - **Sagittal instability** in flexion.
- **Recommendation**: Use **PCL substituting design** to allow mechanical rollback.

## Neuropathic Arthropathy (e.g., Charcot Joint Disease)
- **Challenges**:
  - **Worse outcomes**; avoid TKR if possible.
  - **Bone loss** and wound problems due to neuropathy.
- **Management**: Grafting likely necessary.

## Inflammatory Arthritis
- **Approach**: Resurface patella; use **Posterior Stabilized (PS) Knee**.
- Be cautious of **skin problems** and peri-operative medication management.

## Haemophiliac Arthropathy
- **Considerations**:
  - Increased **HIV risk**.
  - **Higher transfusion requirements**.
  - **Pre-operative angiogram** recommended due to aneurysm risk.
  - Maintain **factor 8 levels at 100%** before surgery.

# Periprosthetic Fractures Around Knee Replacements

## Distal Femur Fractures
### Risk Factors:
- **Osteoporosis**, **Rheumatoid arthritis**, **Immunosuppressants**, **Trauma**.
- **Notching**: Shown to weaken the distal femur but not clinically linked to increased fracture risk.

### Classification:
- **Location of fracture**.
- **Are components loose?**
- **Adequate bone for fixation?**

### Management:
1. **Nonoperative**:
   - For undisplaced fractures in medically unfit patients: Proximal tibial traction or retrograde nail.
2. **Supracondylar fractures**:
   - Open box design, multiple blocking screws, ORIF with fixed angle plate.
3. **Revision TKR**:
   - For loose components, very distal fractures, use stemmed revision knee or hinged knee replacement.
4. **Distal Femoral Replacement**:
   - For elderly or comminuted fractures.

## Tibial Fractures
### Risk Factors:
- **Poor bone quality**, **Loose/infected implants**, **Osteolysis**, **Previous tibial tubercle osteotomy**, **Malalignment**, **Trauma**.

### Classification (Felix et al.):
1. **Type 1**: Fracture of tibial plateau.
2. **Type 2**: Fracture at the level of tibial stem.
3. **Type 3**: Fracture distal to the stem.
4. **Type 4**: Tibial tuberosity fracture.

### Management:
- **Type 1**: Non-operative or ORIF with screws/plates.
- **Type 2**: Same as Type 1.
- **Type 3**: Maintain tibial alignment, non-operative or ORIF, possible external fixation.
- **Type 4**: ORIF with standard methods.

# Patella Fractures

## Risk Factors:
1. **Patient-Related**:
   - Osteoporosis, **Trauma**, **Rheumatoid arthritis**, **Obesity**, **High demand**.
2. **Component-Related**:
   - Patella resurfacing, single PEG patella, uncemented patella, metal-backed patella.
3. **Technical Factors**:
   - **Devascularization** of patella, **Maltracking**, over-resection.

### Classification:
1. **Type 1**: Extensor mechanism intact, component stable.
2. **Type 2**: Extensor mechanism absent, component stable or unstable.
3. **Type 3**: Extensor mechanism intact, component unstable.

### Management Principles:
1. **Priority**: Preserve the extensor mechanism.
2. **Type 1**: Non-operative treatment.
3. **Type 2**: Surgical repair or reconstruction of the extensor mechanism, with possible allograft.
4. **Type 3**: Remove loose components, partial or complete resection of the patella if necessary.
