### Native Knee
- Functions as a 4-bar linkage system with the axis of rotation (COR) through the cruciate ligaments.
- COR moves posteriorly during flexion.
- Femur rolls backward and rotates on the tibia:
  - **Flexion**: Tibia internally rotates due to the LFC being farther back.
  - **Extension**: Tibia externally rotates to "screw home" the knee.

### Original TKR Design
- **Insall Total Contact Condylar Knee**:
  - Highly conforming but did not allow femoral rollback.
  - Tibia initially all-polyethylene; later designs included metal-backed tibias.
  - Posterior femur impinged on poly during flexion, limiting flexion to <100°.
  - Resulted in flexion instability and loosening due to high conformity and impingement.
  - Despite limitations, the design achieved good outcomes.

### Modern TKR Design
Focus: Achieving "normal" femoral rollback.  

#### Two Methods
1. **Retain the PCL**:
   - PCL tension during flexion prevents anterior femoral translation.
   - As the PCL angle changes, the femur rolls back.
2. **Substitute the PCL**:
   - **CAM and post mechanism** replicate femoral rollback:
     - CAM engages the post, pushing the femur backward.
     - Post also prevents anterior instability.

### PCL Retaining

#### Advantages
- Less bone resection.
- More "normal" rollback pattern (more sliding since ACL is resected).
- Less constraint (flatter poly allows rollback), reducing the risk of loosening.

#### Disadvantages
- Technically challenging to balance the knee:
  - PCL contracture can limit balancing in severe deformities.
- Rollback is achieved through sliding, increasing poly wear.
- Less constraint increases contact stress on the poly:
  - Newer designs use more conforming poly.
  - PCL acts more as a static stabilizer.
  - Flexion is achieved by restoring slope and posterior offsetting of the COR.

### PCL Substituting

#### Advantages
- Suitable for almost all knees.
- More conformity reduces edge loading, sliding, and wear.
- Post provides varus-valgus stability.

#### Disadvantages
- Higher conformity may transfer more stress to the implant-bone interface:
  - Theoretical risk of loosening (not proven in practice).
- More bone resection required.
- Not ideal for hyperextending knees:
  - Risk of post fracture or wear.
- **CAM Jump**: Can occur in high flexion or loose flexion gaps.
- **Patella Clunk Syndrome**:
  - Soft tissue impingement in the notch, causing a clunk.

### Indications for PCL Retaining vs. Substituting

#### **PCL Retaining**
1. Knees with significant hyperextension.
2. Patients requiring >130° flexion (e.g., certain cultural activities):
   - Avoids risk of CAM jumping.

#### **PCL Substituting**
1. Post-patellectomy:
   - Weak quads increase the risk of anterior femoral translation.
2. Severe deformities:
   - Non-functioning PCL.
3. Inflammatory arthritis:
   - Potential PCL disease or incompetence.
4. Past PCL injury.

### Mobile Bearing/Rotating Platform Knees
- **Cruciate sacrificing** design with more conforming poly.
- The mobile poly adjusts during flexion and extension:
  - Accommodates minor component positioning errors.
  - Maintains better conformity throughout the ROM.
  - Reduces sliding, high contact stresses, and wear.

#### Unique Problem: **Poly Spinout**
- Poly moves beyond the knee's intended constraints and dislocates anteriorly:
  - Occurs due to a loose flexion gap.
  - Requires revision if it occurs.

#### Outcomes
- Results are comparable to fixed-bearing designs but not significantly superior.
