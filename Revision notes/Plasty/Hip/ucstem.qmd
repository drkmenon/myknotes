title: "Uncemented Stem"
---

## Principle

-   **Primary Objective**: Attain immediate stem stability.\
-   **Secondary Objective**: Achieve subsequent biologic fixation.

### Characteristics

-   **Larger Stems**: Allow more cortical contact.\
-   **Fixation is Biologic**:
    -   Micro-fractures at the implant-bone interface can remodel.\
    -   Fixation depends on achieving biologic integration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reasons for Failure to Achieve Biologic Fixation

1.  **Poor Bone Quality**: Inadequate in-growth or on-growth.\
2.  **Suboptimal Stem Design**: Insufficient in-growth or on-growth capability.\
3.  **Faulty Implantation Technique**:
    -   Inadequate initial stability.\
    -   Leads to fibrous in-growth instead of bony in-growth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Types of Uncemented Stems

### 1. **Porous Coated**

-   **Mechanism**: In-growth of bone.\
-   **Features**:
    -   Metallic stem with pores allowing bone growth.\
    -   Material types:
        -   Titanium with fibers and beads.\
        -   CoCr with sintered beads.

#### Optimal Parameters

| **Parameter**              | **Value** |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Pore Size                  | 50–150 µm |
| Bone-Implant Gap Distance  | 50 µm     |
| Porosity                   | 50%       |
| Maximum Micromotion        | 50–150 µm |
| Ideal HA Coating Thickness | 50 µm     |

-   **Deeper Pores**: Provide shear stability but risk coating shear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Grit Blasted or HA Coated**

-   **Mechanism**: On-growth of bone.\
-   **Biologic Fixation**: Bone grows onto the roughened surface.

#### Grit Blasting

-   **Process**: Surface roughened by particle spray.\
-   **Features**:
    -   Bone adheres to pits and valleys.\
    -   Surface roughness determines shear resistance.

#### HA Coating

-   **Material**: Osteoconductive ceramic (\[Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂\]).\
-   **Features**:
    -   Bidirectional biologic fixation (bone-prosthesis and vice versa).\
    -   Reduces gaps faster than other methods.\
    -   Ideal for revision surgeries.\
-   **Optimal Composition**:
    -   High crystallinity for biological activity.\
    -   Thickness of 50 µm (thicker coatings risk shearing).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Techniques of Uncemented Fixation

### Principles

1.  **Early Stability**: Minimize micromotion to \<50 µm for bony bonding.\
2.  **Avoid Fibrous Bonding**: Prevent subsidence.

### Two Techniques

1.  **Press Fit**
    -   Bone preparation is smaller than the implant.\
    -   Implant impaction generates hoop stresses, stabilizing the implant.\
    -   **Risks**: Higher risk of fracture.
2.  **Line-to-Line Fit**
    -   Bone preparation matches the implant size.\
    -   Extensively porous-coated implants distribute shear stress.\
    -   Provides a strong grip on the bone.

## Supplementary Fixation

-   **Screws in Cup**: Often used to provide additional fixation.\
-   **Cortical Contact**: Preferred for stability.
    -   Cancellous bone allows ingrowth but leads to more micromotion.\
    -   In the cup, aim for cortical rim fit.\
    -   In the stem, the largest possible size ensures some cortical contact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stress Shielding

-   **Definition**: Bone density reduction proximal to or around a well-fixed stem due to decreased physiological loading, caused by the stiffer implant sharing the load.\
-   **More Common with Uncemented Stems**:
    -   Cemented stems have a damping effect due to the flexibility of cement, which provides a transitional zone between stem and bone.\
    -   **Stress Shielding is Less Common in Cemented Stems**: Cement’s flexibility reduces modulus mismatch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Consequences of Stress Shielding

1.  **Does not affect longevity**: As long as the stem is well fixed.\
2.  **Predisposes to fractures**: Around the stem, especially with uncemented stems.\
3.  **Revision Challenges**: Loss of bone stock makes revision surgery difficult.

### Main Factors Contributing to Stress Shielding

1.  **Stem Stiffness**\
2.  **Extent and Distribution of Porous Coating**

**Worst combination for stress shielding**: A long, fat, cylindrical, fully porous-coated CoCr stem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stem Stiffness

Influencing Factors:\
1. **Size**: Stiffness increases by the 4th power of stem radius.\
2. **Material**: CoCr is stiffer than titanium.\
3. **Shape**:\
- Cylindrical stems are stiffer than tapered ones.\
- Solid stems are stiffer than fluted/hollow ones.\
- Long stems stress shield more.

### Measures to Reduce Stem Stiffness

-   **Tapering the stem**\
-   **Adding flutes**\
-   **Using a Cemented Stem**: Cement provides a dampening effect on stress transfer, although cemented stems must be stiffer due to their smaller size.
    -   Using **Titanium**: Although titanium is less stiff, it can generate more wear particles, which are undesirable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extent of Porous Coating

-   **Full Coating**: Results in diaphyseal (shaft) ingrowth and causes proximal stress shielding.
    -   **Spot Welding**: Increased density around the distal tip; load dissipates distally.\
    -   **Proximal Coating**: Distributes the load more evenly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collared Implants

### In Cemented Stems

-   **Collar Function**: Promotes loading through the proximal medial bone (where stress shielding occurs).
    -   **Risk**: Collar may not seat directly against bone, leading to lysis under the collar.

### In Uncemented Stems

-   **Controversial Use**:
    -   Collar may prevent full seating of the prosthesis, leading to a loose stem.\
    -   If seated properly, provides the most physiologically similar strain to native bone.\
    -   Protects against subsidence, but cementing may be a better option in such cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Morse Taper

-   **Definition**: A cone-in-cone taper used to join rotating parts like drill bits and chucks.\
-   **Working Principle**:
    -   The trunion (male) and bore (female) are nearly the same taper, with the bore being slightly smaller.\
    -   Impaction of the bore onto the trunion generates opposing stresses.\
    -   **Result**: A reliable interlock.\
-   **In THR (Total Hip Replacement)**:
    -   The taper may be subject to fretting and corrosion.\
    -   **Precautions**: Components must be clean and dry before assembly.\
    -   Taper sizes vary between manufacturers; mixing is not recommended unless the exact taper is matched.\
    -   **Common Taper Size**: 12/14 taper.
