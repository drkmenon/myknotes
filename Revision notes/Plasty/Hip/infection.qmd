## MSIS Criteria

The **Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS)** proposes a new definition for prosthetic joint infections:

### Major Criteria (Diagnosis can be made when \[1\] major criterion exists)

1.  Sinus tract communicating with prosthesis\
2.  Pathogen isolated by culture from 2 separate tissue/fluid samples from the affected joint

### Minor Criteria (Diagnosis can be made when \[4/6\] of the following minor criteria exist)

1.  Elevated ESR (\>30mm/h) or CRP (\>10mg/L)\
2.  Elevated synovial WBC (\>1,100 cells/μL for knees, \>3,000 cells/μL for hips)\
3.  Elevated synovial PMN (\>64% for knees, \>80% for hips)\
4.  Purulence in affected joint (*Note: This finding alone is insufficient as fluid from metal-metal articulation, gout, etc., can resemble pus*)\
5.  Pathogen isolation in 1 culture\
6.  5 PMN per HPF in 5 HPF at ×400 magnification (intraoperative frozen section of periprosthetic tissue)

## Epidemiology

-   Occurs in \~1% of primary joints and \~5% of revisions\
-   Knees \> Hips

## Risk Factors

-   Superficial infection\
-   Hematoma and wound ooze\
-   Inflammatory arthropathy\
-   Diabetes\
-   Immunosuppressive drugs\
-   Poor nutrition\
-   Revision surgery\
-   Peri-operative infection at another site\
-   Malignancy or prior radiotherapy

## Prevention

### Pre-Operative

-   Screening for MRSA, ulcers, and UTI\
-   Admission on the day of surgery to a ring-fenced ward\
-   Urine dipstick test on admission day\
-   Optimization of comorbidities and nutrition

### Peri-Operative

-   Laminar flow – Ex Flow (well-maintained and regularly tested)\
-   Low traffic\
-   Antibiotics within 1 hour of incision\
-   Antibiotic-loaded cement\
-   Shaving at the time of surgery\
-   Good handwashing technique\
-   Draping with disposable drapes and ioband\
-   Opening sets within laminar flow\
-   Efficient surgery, good hemostasis, and sound wound closure\
-   No hypothermia or hypotension

### Post-Operative

-   Interactive dressing\
-   Minimize dressing changes\
-   Cultivate infection control – use of alcoholic gel; bare below elbows, etc.\
-   Minimize unnecessary transfusions\
-   Post-operative antibiotics for 24 hours\
-   Early mobilization and physiotherapy\
-   Optimal medical management\
-   Timely but safe discharge

## Classification

1.  **Acute** – Within 1 month\
2.  **Late Chronic** – \>1 month, indolent chronic infection\
3.  **Acute Hematogenous** – Many years later in a previously sterile joint\
4.  **Subclinical** – Found only on intra-operative cultures

## History & Examination

-   Hints at the type of infection and differentiates it from other causes\
-   **Pain** – Cardinal feature (95% of infected joints have pain)
    -   Rest pain, night pain, worsening pain (differentiates from loosening)\
-   Systemic upset\
-   Recent infection elsewhere – acute hematogenous

## Radiology

### X-Ray

-   Periosteal reaction\
-   Foci of osteolysis (rather than lucent lines seen in loosening)\
-   Cortical destruction\
-   Bone loss without significant prosthetic wear

### Bone Scans

-   Standard bone scan: **99% sensitivity**, but only **40% specificity**\
-   Triple-phase scans: Improve specificity to **95%**
    -   **Technetium-99** – Detects inflammation\
    -   **Indium-111** – Detects leukocytes (may also be present in loosening)

### PET Scan

-   Uses fluorinated glucose – migrates to areas of high metabolic activity\
-   **98% sensitivity and specificity** reported

## Blood Tests

### Combined CRP and ESR

-   **99% sensitivity, 90% specificity**\
-   ESR elevated up to 90 days post-op; CRP up to 21 days\
-   Rising trend is worrisome

### Interleukin-6

-   Useful for diagnosis and monitoring\
-   Expensive

## Joint Aspiration

-   **Sensitivity:** 50-90%, **Specificity:** 95%\
-   Sensitivity increases with repeat aspirations and avoiding antibiotics\
-   Specificity improves with good technique (reduces false positives)

### Synovial Fluid WCC

-   1,100 WCCs & 70% neutrophil differential diagnostic in knees (Parvizi)

-   3,500 WCCs and 75% neutrophil differential diagnostic in all joints (Dalle Valle)

## Microbiology

### Gram Stain

-   Poor sensitivity (25%)\
-   Negative Gram stain is meaningless\
-   Positive Gram stain almost certainly indicates infection

### Frozen Section

-   5 PMNs/HPF = positive

-   **Specificity:** 85%, **Sensitivity:** 95%

-   Useful for equivocal pre-op evaluation or worrisome intra-op appearance

### Molecular Techniques

-   PCR amplifies bacterial DNA (*risk of false positives due to contamination*)\
-   Bacterial gene and protein targeting (*not widely available*)

## Bacteriology of Periprosthetic Infection

### Staphylococcus

-   **Staph aureus:** Main coagulase-positive species
    -   Secretes coagulase, converting fibrinogen to fibrin → Clotting protects against phagocytosis\
-   **Staph epidermidis:** Main coagulase-negative species
    -   Less virulent, but highly pathogenic within a biofilm

### Glycocalyx and Biofilm

-   **Glycocalyx**: Protective layer secreted by bacteria; increases resistance to phagocytosis and adhesion to metal\
-   **Biofilm**: Bacterial community within a glycocalyx
    -   Takes \~4 weeks to form\
    -   Makes bacteria even more resistant to phagocytosis, better at adhering, and self-sufficient

## Management Options

1.  **Non-Operative** – Suppression with long-term antibiotics\
2.  **Washout and Debridement with Prosthetic Retention**\
3.  **Single- or Two-Stage Joint Revision**\
4.  **Resection Arthroplasty/Arthrodesis**\
5.  **Amputation**

### Washout and Prosthetic Retention

-   Large volume irrigation\
-   Exchange easily removable implants (e.g., femoral heads, polyethylene)\
-   Long-term antibiotics (6 weeks)\
-   Only viable \<4 weeks due to biofilm formation\
-   Suitable for acute or acute hematogenous infections

### Two-Stage Joint Revision

#### Prerequisites

-   Fit patient with adequate bone and soft tissue\
-   Serologic and tissue-proven eradication of infection

#### First Stage

-   Thorough debridement, removal of all prosthetic material (including cement)\
-   Multiple cultures (≥5 samples)\
-   Spacer implantation

#### Interim Stage

-   IV antibiotics for 6 weeks\
-   Antibiotic-free period for 2 weeks → Aspiration and ESR/CRP testing

#### Second Stage

-   Frozen section (\>5 PMNs in 3/5 samples = ongoing infection)\
-   Negative: Proceed to revision; Positive: Re-debride and re-insert spacers

**Results:** 90-95% success

### Single-Stage Revision

#### Prerequisites

-   Identified sensitive organism\
-   Adequate bone and soft tissue coverage

#### Surgical Principles

-   Aggressive debridement, irrigation, and removal of prosthesis\
-   New prosthesis implantation with antibiotic cement\
-   Long post-operative antibiotics

**Results:**\
- Not as successful as two-stage revisions\
- Better in hips than knees

### Excision Arthroplasty

-   For non-ambulatory or frail patients

### Arthrodesis

-   For ambulatory patients

### Amputation

-   For cases with inadequate bone or soft tissue

### Antibiotic Cement Spacers

#### Benefits

-   Maintains tissue planes\
-   Prevents instability\
-   Preserves mobility\
-   Allows local antibiotic delivery\
-   Eases the second stage

#### Types of Spacers

1.  **Static:** Minimal motion, risk of soft tissue issues\
2.  **Dynamic:** Allows mobility, better soft tissue maintenance

#### Antibiotic Choice

-   Heat-stable, water-soluble antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin, tobramycin)

#### Factors Affecting Elution

1.  Antibiotic type\
2.  Cement type\
3.  Porosity\
4.  Surface area\
5.  Mixing technique

#### Antibiotic Dosing

-   Limit: 8g per 40g of cement\
-   Common: 3.2g tobramycin + 3g vancomycin per 40g
