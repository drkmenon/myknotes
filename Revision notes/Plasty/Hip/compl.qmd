## Vascular Injury

-   **Causes**:
    -   Cement removal
    -   Screw placement
    -   Retractor use

### Zones for Screw Placement

-   **Safe Zone**: Posterior Superior (minimal danger to sciatic and superior gluteal vessels & nerves)
-   **Danger Zones**:
    -   **Anterior Superior**: Danger to external iliac vessels and medial to iliopsoas
    -   **Anterior Inferior**: Obturator vessels, behind quadrilateral plate and obturator foramen
    -   **Posterior Inferior**: Safe for screws \<20mm; at risk for pudendal and inferior gluteal vessels, sciatic and inferior gluteal nerves

### Management of Hemorrhage

-   **Management Options**:
    -   Pack areas of bleeding
    -   Products: Tranexamic acid, transfusion, FFP
    -   If severe, call the vascular team, perform retroperitoneal approach and clamping of common iliac artery.
    -   Consider pre-operative angiography/vascular standby if cup migration is chronic.

## Nerve Injury

### Aetiology

-   **Sciatic Nerve Injury**: 80%
-   **Femoral Nerve Injury**: 20%
-   **Other Nerves**: \<1%

### Sciatic Nerve Injury

-   **Risk Factors**:
    -   Revision surgery
    -   Females
    -   Lengthening \>4cm
-   **Causes**:
    -   Retractor placement posterior inferior to acetabulum
    -   Haematoma, cement, cages, screws, direct laceration (uncommon)
    -   Most injuries involve the peroneal branch (more lateral, closer to retractors)
    -   20% of cases are complete palsy
-   **Management**:
    -   Foot drop splint, physio to maintain joint motion.
    -   If nerve is intact, avoid exploration.
    -   If unsure of completeness, explore early if no improvement after 6 weeks.
    -   **Prognosis**:
        -   Good indicators: improvement within 3 weeks, delayed symptom onset, incomplete palsy.

### Femoral Nerve Injury

-   **Less Common**:
    -   Often caused by retractors not positioned within the capsule.
    -   Management involves physiotherapy and knee braces for quads recovery.

### Obturator Nerve Injury

-   **Uncommon**:
    -   Caused by deep retractors in obturator foramen or cement extrusion.
    -   Main symptom is groin pain.

### Superior Gluteal Nerve Injury

-   **Risk**:
    -   Mainly occurs if muscle split in gluteus medius exceeds 5cm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Leg Length Discrepancy

-   **True Lengthening**: More common than shortening; usually better tolerated if \<1cm; \>2.5cm poorly tolerated.
-   **Intraoperative Checks**:
    -   Matching neck cut to templating
    -   Shuck test, soft tissue tension, kick-back test, knee palpation, markers with measuring devices.
-   **Classification**:
    -   **True**: Due to surgical error (e.g., inferior cup placement, inappropriate neck length).
    -   **Apparent**: Due to contracture pre- or post-op.
-   **Management**:
    -   **Apparent**: Reassurance and physiotherapy for stretching.
    -   **True**: Identify and correct significant issues; shoe raise for minor discrepancies (\<2cm).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fat Embolus Syndrome

-   **In THR**: Most common in cemented stems in elderly patients.
-   **In TKR**: Related to intramedullary referencing; risk increases with number of intramedullary rods used.

### Pathophysiology of Fat Embolus in THR

-   **Cause**: Pressurization of canal during stem insertion causes fat and cement embolization, occluding capillaries in the lungs.
-   **Symptoms**:
    -   Rapid hypotension (within 30 minutes)
    -   Hypoxia
    -   Petechial hemorrhages

### Why It's Worse in Elderly:

-   Osteoporotic bone increases fat dissemination under pressurization.
-   Underlying comorbidities (e.g., chronic pulmonary disease) exacerbate the effects of embolization.

### Management

-   **Supportive Care**:
    -   Oxygen
    -   Fluids
    -   Vasopressors
    -   Ventilation if necessary
