## Typical Deformities

### Acetabulum

Primary deformity in hip dysplasia is the acetabulum:

1\. Lateralised

2\. Shallow

3\. Retroverted

4\. Deficient anteriorly and superiorly

### Femur

1.  Valgus neck
2.  Anteverted neck
3.  Small head
4.  Posterior greater trochanter (GT)
5.  Narrow canal
6.  Shortened leg

### Consequences

-   Lateralised centre of rotation
-   Increased body weight lever arm
-   High contact pressures
-   Premature osteoarthritis (OA)
-   Tendency for superolateral migration

## Assessment

### History

-   Previous surgeries
-   Impingement symptoms
-   Family history
-   Childhood history

### Examination

-   Signs of impingement
-   Leg lengths
-   Range of motion (ROM)
-   Other deformities (e.g., spine)

### X-Ray (XR)

-   **Lateral CE angle**:\
    Normally \> 25 degrees; \<20 means a dysplastic acetabulum
-   **Anterior CE angle**:\
    Should be \>25 degrees (anteverted)
-   **Acetabular index**
-   **Crossover sign**:\
    Indicates retroverted acetabulum
-   **Tönnis Angle**:\
    Top of femoral head and slope of acetabular roof should be \<15 degrees

### CT Scan

-   Useful in planning treatment (e.g., osteotomy)

## Classification - Crowe and Tönnis Grades

### Crowe Classification

Based on the ratio of the distance between the inter-teardrop line and the head-neck junction with the opposite femoral head diameter. If the opposite femoral head is deformed, substitute 20% of pelvic height.

-   **Type 1**: \<50% proximal migration
-   **Type 2**: 50-75% proximal migration
-   **Type 3**: 75-100% proximal migration
-   **Type 4**: \>100% proximal migration

## Management

### Non-Arthroplasty Options

Aim is to resolve pain and slow progression of OA:

1\. Analgesia and activity modification

2\. Arthroscopy

3\. Periacetabular osteotomy

4\. Femoral osteotomy

5\. Arthrodesis

6\. Resection arthroplasty

#### Arthroscopy and Labral Debridement

-   Indicated for Crowe type 1 with minimal acetabular or femoral deformity
-   Results poor if bony deformities are left uncorrected

#### Pelvic Osteotomy – Corrective or Salvage

Aims to provide a congruent joint with femoral head coverage and redistribute contact pressures.

-   **Corrective Osteotomy**:
    -   For mild to moderate dysplasia with minimal OA
    -   Preferred over femoral osteotomy as acetabulum is the primary problem
    -   **Bernese Periacetabular Osteotomy**:
        -   Large corrections possible
        -   Extra-articular
        -   Single incision
        -   Good results by multiple authors
    -   Other corrective osteotomies:
        -   **Salter**: For children; relies on supple symphysis
        -   **Triple innominate**: Risk of AVN of acetabulum
-   **Salvage Osteotomy**:
    -   Rare due to success of Bernese osteotomy
    -   Indicated in severe dysplasia with insurmountable deformity
    -   Types: **Chiari** or **Shelf**

#### Femoral Osteotomy

Indicated if:

\- Acetabular development in children depends on head reduction

\- Predominant femoral deformity and minimal acetabular deformity (rare)

\- Coverage of head not achieved with pelvic osteotomy

#### Arthrodesis

-   Rare; for severe dysplasia, advanced OA, and poor arthroplasty candidates
-   Indications: Cerebral palsy or polio
-   Pain relief at the expense of function; only for unilateral dysplasia

#### Resection Arthroplasty

-   Indications similar to arthrodesis but for non-ambulatory patients
-   Lower morbidity surgery
-   Complications:
    -   Shortening
    -   Chronic pain
    -   Difficulty ambulating

## Arthroplasty in Hip Dysplasia

### Aims

-   Restore normal hip centre of rotation
-   Provide adequate acetabular coverage
-   Ensure long-lasting fixation

### Potential Problems

#### Soft Tissue Contracture

-   Hamstrings, adductors, and rectus femoris
-   Abductors are more transverse and less functional
-   Thickened capsule and iliopsoas
-   Shortened sciatic nerve (palsy more common if \>4cm lengthening)
-   THR instability

#### Approach

-   Acetabular exposure is difficult:
    -   Consider trochanteric osteotomy
    -   Consider subtrochanteric osteotomy if femur needs shortening

### Acetabulum

-   Difficult to identify the true acetabulum
-   Small components required due to underdeveloped acetabulum
-   Poor medial bone stock
-   Lateral acetabular erosion (especially in Crowe type 2 and 3 hips)

#### Options:

-   Superolateral bone grafting
-   High hip centre (undesirable)
-   Medialisation of cup through the medial wall
-   Crowe type 1 and 4 hips usually have good lateral bone

### Femur

Deformities include:

\- Narrow canal (affects stem selection)

\- Posterior GT (may require osteotomy and reattachment)

\- Valgus neck (requires low neck cut)

\- Anteverted neck (avoid using native femur as a guide to version)

#### Stem Selection

-   Narrow canal requires small stems
-   DDH stems have reduced metaphyseal flare
-   Uncemented stems preferred in younger patients
-   Modular stems help correct version
-   Risk: Placement in anteversion

### Femoral Shortening

-   Necessary for Crowe type 3 and 4:
    -   Contractures prevent reduction into the normal hip centre
    -   Options:
        -   Subtrochanteric osteotomy (better but more difficult)
        -   Metaphyseal resection and distalisation of GT (easier but risks non-union)

### Results

-   Worse than standard THR due to complexity
-   More complications and younger, active patients
-   Uncemented results generally better
-   Crowe type 1 outcomes are better than type 3 and 4
