## Conversion of a Hip Arthrodesis to THR

### Indications

-   Pain in other joints due to hip fusion, especially in the other hip and ipsilateral knee
-   Previously arthrodesed hip; patient now desires increased range of motion (ROM)

### Pre-Op Workup

-   Investigate the reason for the original arthrodesis
-   Rule out ongoing infection if arthrodesis was due to or complicated by infection

### Principles & Potential Problems

1.  Proximal femoral deformity
2.  Lack of reference for neck cut
3.  Lack of reference for cup position (TAL often still present)
4.  Bleeding
5.  Bone loss (uncommon)

-   Functioning abductors are essential for a good outcome
-   Assess abductors clinically, using MRI (fatty infiltration) or EMG
-   Use retained hardware or visible trochanter as reference for neck cut
-   Place retractor in obturator foramen to visualize cup placement
-   Intra-operative X-ray can help assess cup position before reaming
-   Generally, good bone stock for cup placement
-   If proximal femoral deformity or sclerosis is present, consider using burrs, drills, or osteotomy

## Paget's Disease

### Causes of Hip Pain

-   Secondary arthritis
-   Deformity
-   Stress fracture
-   Sarcomatous change
-   Referred pain from the spine

### Typical Deformities

-   Varus neck
-   Antero-lateral bowing of the femur
-   Protrusio

### Possible Problems

-   Hypervascular tissues, especially in active disease, leading to significant blood loss
-   Risk of intra-pelvic perforation
-   Bone may be osteoporotic or sclerotic

### Pre-Operative Considerations

-   Evaluate for significant proximal femoral deformity; obtain full femur X-rays
-   Plan for osteotomy if necessary
-   Use burrs and drills to open the canal
-   Pre-operative treatment with bisphosphonates and calcitonin to reduce disease activity
-   Prepare for protrusio
-   Avoid lengthening if the neck is in varus
-   Warn the anesthetist about the potential for high output failure in active disease

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gaucher’s Disease

-   Commonly presents with AVN; consider in any patient with AVN
-   Bone infiltrated with structurally weak Gaucher's cells
-   High risk of intra-operative fractures and bleeding
-   Post-operative pain is common
-   Many patients have had a splenectomy, increasing infection risk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sickle Cell Anemia

### Potential Problems

-   AVN and its complications
-   Very sclerotic canal due to prior sickle cell crises and infarcts
-   Hypervascular tissues leading to bleeding
-   Increased infection risk, particularly in asplenic patients
-   Pain management challenges due to long-term opioid use

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hemophilia

### Characteristics

-   Hemophilic arthropathy typically affects the knee and elbow; less common in the hip
-   Deformities resemble Perthes disease with a flattened head
-   Often associated with acetabular dysplasia

### Main Concerns

-   Bleeding and infection
-   Requires close collaboration with a hematologist in an MDT center

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tumors

### Indications for THR

-   Metastases
-   Low-grade malignancies, such as chondrosarcoma
-   Benign aggressive lesions, e.g., PVNS or GCT

### Principles

-   Determine the nature of the lesion
-   Plan surgical margins
-   Select the appropriate prosthesis (standard, revision type, or endoprosthesis)
-   Preserve abductors if possible
-   MDT collaboration is essential for adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Neuromuscular Disorders

-   Examples include Parkinson’s disease
-   Instability caused by contractures (flexion, adduction deformities)
-   Treatment:
    -   Release adductors, rectus femoris, and psoas
    -   Use an anterolateral approach and over-antevert the cup
-   Patients are prone to skin breakdown and systemic infections post-operatively

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI)

### Aetiology

-   Pain due to a labral tear, caused by acute or chronic trauma
-   Often associated with structural issues, commonly CAM lesions
-   May be secondary to conditions such as SUFE or Perthes
-   Evidence suggests FAI is a leading cause of early-onset OA

### Pathophysiology

#### CAM Impingement

-   Mismatch in the radius of curvature between the femoral head and acetabulum
-   Labral tear leads to separation at the chondro-labral junction
-   Progresses to delamination and unstable chondral flaps

#### Pincer Impingement

-   Femoral neck impinges on the acetabulum during ROM
-   Associated with conditions like coxa profunda, protrusio, or acetabular retroversion
-   Leads to acetabular lesions with cystic degeneration

### Clinical Features

-   Deep-seated groin pain exacerbated by hip flexion (e.g., sprinting, kicking, rising from chairs)
-   Pincer impingement often causes buttock pain during leg extension
-   Associated clicking is common with labral tears

### Examination

-   Positive impingement sign
-   Reduced internal rotation

### Imaging

#### X-Ray (AP and Cross-Table Lateral)

-   Evaluate acetabular abnormalities:
    -   Centre Edge angle (\<15 degrees diagnostic of dysplasia)
    -   Protrusio
    -   Retroversion
-   Evaluate femoral abnormalities:
    -   Neck-shaft angle
    -   Offset ratio (\<0.15 diagnostic of CAM)
    -   Alpha angle (\>50 degrees diagnostic of CAM)

#### MRI Arthrogram

-   Gold standard for diagnosing labral and chondrolabral tears
-   Detects subtle CAM deformities

#### CT Scan

-   Useful for identifying dysplasia and subtle deformities

### Management

#### Non-Operative

-   Worth attempting but unlikely to resolve symptoms
-   Aim to prevent arthritic changes

#### Arthroscopic Surgery

-   Recommended for isolated CAM deformity with labral tears
-   Most common treatment

#### Open Surgical Dislocation

-   Less common due to advancements in arthroscopic techniques

#### Osteotomy (Periacetabular or Proximal Femoral)

-   Used for cases of dysplasia where labral repair alone is insufficient

#### Arthroplasty

-   Suitable for patients with debilitating symptoms and OA
-   Options include THR or resurfacing
