## Risk Factors

### Surgical Factors

1.  Component malposition\
2.  Inadequate offset restoration (abductors de-tensioned)\
3.  Impingement – bony or component\
4.  Shortening\
5.  Poor soft tissue repair (especially posterior approach)\
6.  Conversion of failed ORIF to THR

### Patient Factors

1.  Cognitive impairment\
2.  High range of motion (ROM)\
3.  Contact sports

## Determinants of Hip Stability

1.  Component design\
2.  Component position\
3.  Soft tissue tension\
4.  Soft tissue function

### Component Design

#### Primary Arc Range

-   Defines the ROM arc before impingement occurs\
-   **Main determinant:** Head-neck ratio
    -   Higher head-neck ratio = greater primary arc range

#### Excursion Distance

-   Distance traveled by the head before dislocation once impingement occurs\
-   **Main determinant:** Head size
    -   Excursion distance is half the head size
        -   Example: 11mm for a 22mm head, 16mm for a 32mm head

**Larger heads are inherently more stable because:**\
1. Greater primary arc range (increased head-neck ratio)\
2. Larger excursion distance

#### Taper Size

-   Narrower tapers increase the head-neck ratio and enhance stability\
-   Collared stems tend to have larger necks, reducing the head-neck ratio

#### Acetabular Augmentation

-   Hooded cups are designed to aid stability but can lower the primary arc range\
-   Constrained liners contain the head but drastically reduce the primary arc range
    -   Leads to excessive stress transfer to the cup-bone interface, causing early loosening

### Component Position

-   A patient’s native hip has a larger head-neck ratio and larger head, making it inherently more stable

**Goal:**\
- Place THR in the middle of the patient’s functional range, providing leeway if the primary arc range is exceeded

**Ideal Component Positioning:**\
- **Cup anteversion:** 15–30 degrees\
- **Combined anteversion:** 30–40 degrees\
- **Cup inclination:** 35–45 degrees

*Note: This may vary slightly based on the approach and implants used*

### Soft Tissue Tension

-   **Key muscles:** Abductors
    -   Provide joint reaction force (JRF) to stabilize the hip

**Impact of reduced offset or neck length:**\
1. De-tensioning of abductors\
2. Predisposing to trochanteric impingement in abduction

### Soft Tissue Dysfunction

-   Causes may be central or peripheral neurologic issues\
-   Often multifactorial in elderly patients

## Management of the Dislocated THR

-   Hips that dislocate more than twice usually require revision surgery\
-   Important to document the position of the hip and activity during dislocation\
-   During closed reduction, document the position of instability

### Use of Braces

-   Not always necessary\
-   Knee splints prevent flexion (posterior instability)\
-   Abduction braces allow tissues to contract in a better position

**Best predictor of successful revision surgery:**\
- Understanding the cause of instability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### Eccentric Poly Wear

-   Common cause of dislocation\
-   Rectified with poly exchange

### Component Malposition

-   Diagnosed via X-ray or CT scans\
-   Must be revised even if well-fixed

### Inadequate Offset or Neck Length

-   Revision needed to restore or increase abductor tension

### Increasing Head Size

-   Increases primary arc and excursion distance

### Trochanteric Advancement

-   Useful for increasing abductor tension if all else is satisfactory\
-   Not effective for trochanteric escape or pull-off

### Constrained Liner

-   Last resort after addressing all other factors

### Conversion to Hemiarthroplasty

-   Not possible with acetabular defects (risk of intra-pelvic migration)\
-   Suitable for low-demand patients

### Resection Arthroplasty

-   Absolute last resort for low-demand patients where all else has failed
