## Classification

### Gruen Zones

1-7 starting at GT ending at Calcar

### Charnley Zones

1-3 starting laterally ending medially

### Key Feature

Progression of lucent lines is the key feature

## Femoral Stem

### Cemented Stem Loosening

#### 9 Possible Radiologic Findings to Note:

1.  Radiolucency between stem and cement mantle\
2.  Radiolucency between cement and bone\
3.  Subsidence of stem within cement mantle\
4.  Subsidence of cement mantle within bone\
5.  Stem position changed to varus\
6.  Bending of the stem\
7.  Fracture of the stem\
8.  Rarefaction of the cement or fragmentation of cement\
9.  Cement mantle fracture (usually at stem tip – zone 4)

## Differentiating Age-Related Changes from Loosening

### With Aging:

-   Femur expands to compensate for decreased bone mass\
-   Leads to lucency at the bone-cement interface (does not indicate a loose stem)

#### Features of Age-Related Changes:

-   No sclerotic line around lucent areas\
-   Lucency is uniform\
-   No pain

#### Features of True Loosening:

-   Lucent areas are scalloped and non-uniform\
-   Sclerotic lines present where remodeling has occurred\
-   Pain is present

## Technical Errors Contributing to Poor Cement Mantle

1.  Removal of all cancellous bone\
2.  Stem movement while cement hardening\
3.  Cement voids (pigtail catheter, bone, blood, etc.)\
4.  Inadequate pressurization\
5.  Poor stem position – point contact with bone\
6.  Inadequate cement mantle size (\<2mm or \<1/3 canal)

## Modes of Cemented Stem Failure

### Modes of Failure:

Dependent on the quality of cement fixation in various zones around the stem.

1.  **Pistoning (stem inside cement mantle)**\
2.  **Pistoning (cement mantle within bone)**\
3.  **Pivoting of mid-stem**\
4.  **Pivoting at calcar**\
5.  **Bending - cantilever**

### Mode 1a: Pistoning (Stem Inside Cement Mantle)

-   **Cause:** Inadequate bonding of cement with the whole stem\
-   **Associated Finding:** Zone 4 cement fracture due to axial pistoning

**XR Findings:**\
- Stem subsidence\
- Lucency in zones 1 and 2\
- Distal cement fracture

### Mode 1b: Pistoning (Cement Mantle Within Bone)

-   **Cause:** Poor bonding of cement with bone
    -   Inadequate pressurization\
    -   Removal of all cancellous bone

**XR Findings:**\
- Lucency in all 7 zones\
- Whole cement mantle subsidence with stem still incorporated

### Mode 2: Pivoting of Mid-Stem

-   **Cause:** Poor cement fixation proximal medially and distal laterally\
-   **Mechanism:** Stem pivots around mid-point into varus

**XR Findings:**\
- Medial migration of proximal stem\
- Lateral migration of distal stem\
- Fracture around mid-stem pivot point (zones 2 and 6)

### Mode 3: Pivoting at Calcar

-   **Cause:** Poor distal cement fixation\
-   **Mechanism:** Distal stem acts like a windscreen wiper while pivoting around the well-fixed calcar

**XR Findings:**\
- Lucency in zones 4 and 5\
- Sclerosis and thickening around the stem tip

### Mode 4: Bending - Cantilever

-   **Cause:** Poor proximal fixation with solid distal fixation\
-   **Outcome:** Stem bends as it is anchored distally and eventually fractures

**XR Findings:**\
- Lucency in zones 1, 7, 2, and 6\
- Stem fracture

## Uncemented Stem Loosening

### Classification of Uncemented Stem Fixation:

1.  **Well-Fixed Stem with Bony Ingrowth**\
2.  **Stable Stem with Fibrous Ingrowth**\
3.  **Loose Stem**

### XR Features:

#### Well-Fixed Stems:

-   No radiolucent lines\
-   May have cortical hypertrophy where porous coating ends\
-   Proximal stress shielding indicates good, stable distal fixation

#### Stable Fibrous Stems:

-   Uniform radiolucent line \<1mm\
-   Sclerotic line outlining the radiolucency\
-   No subsidence

#### Unstable Stems:

-   Divergent, irregular radiolucent lines\
-   Spot welds or areas of localized bone hypertrophy (e.g., at calcar or stem tip)\
-   Indicate stem movement and lack of uniform loading

### Summary of Key Findings:

-   **Well-Fixed Stem:** No lucent lines, uniform hypertrophy\
-   **Localized Hypertrophy:** At stem tip indicating pistoning or abnormal loading
