title: "Hip Arthrodesis"
order: 12
---

## Indications

-   Young patients (\<30 years) with debilitating arthritis
-   Previously infected hip with end-stage joint destruction
-   Heavy laborers\
    *(Resurfacing may be a better option)*

## Prerequisites

-   Adjacent joints (spine, knee, other hip) must be normal
-   No active sepsis
-   No major limb length discrepancy (fusion will cause further shortening)

## Position of Fusion

-   **30 degrees flexion**: Clears foot and allows comfortable sitting
-   **5 degrees adduction**: Prevents abductor lurch
-   **5 degrees external rotation**: Prevents tripping

## Instrumentation

-   Rigid fixation of well-opposed joint surfaces with fixed-angle plates

## Results & Complications

-   Generally good; reports in children show \>20 years of good function
-   Failure often due to adjacent joint disease, which is the most common reason for conversion to Total Hip Replacement (THR)
-   Complications:
    -   50% experience back pain
    -   40% have ipsilateral knee pain
    -   20% have contralateral hip pain
    -   Non-union is uncommon but can occur

## Conversion to THR

-   Results are not as good as primary THR
-   Challenges include:
    -   Soft tissue contracture and wasting
    -   Functional abductors are critical for good outcomes
    -   Risks: Instability, limp, and pain
