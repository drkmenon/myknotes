**Best Long-Term Results**:\
Partly because there are many uncemented designs without equivalent longevity.

### Evolution of Cementing Technique

| **Generation** | **Technique** | **Features** |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1st** | Finger Packing | Sharp-edged stem. |
| **2nd (1975)** | Cement Gun (retrograde) | Pulse lavage, pressurization. |
| **3rd (1982)** | Vacuum Mixing (porosity reduction) | Canal brushed/dried, stem centralizer, cement restrictor, rough stem finish. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cement Mantle Size

-   **Minimum**: 2 mm.\
-   **Ideal**: 4 mm proximally, 2 mm distally.\
-   **Ratio**: Stem fills 2/3 of the canal; 1/3 is cement.\
-   **Challenges**: Narrow canals make achieving this difficult.

> **Note**: Proximal mantle is where stems typically loosen first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cemented Stems

-   **Stiffness**:
    -   High Young's modulus directs load away from the proximal mantle, reducing early loosening.\
    -   Can lead to stress shielding, though typically associated with uncemented stems.
-   **Design**:
    -   Should avoid sharp edges to prevent high contact pressure points in the cement mantle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Two Broad Design Types

#### Composite Beam

-   Example: **Charnley**.\
-   **Reliant on**: Immediate stability, no micromotion within the cement mantle.\
-   **Features**:
    -   Matt finish or slightly roughened.\
    -   Collar or flange to prevent migration.\
-   **Load Dissipation**: Primarily at the tip of the stem.

#### Taper Slip

-   Example: **Exeter**.\
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   Initial migration into the cement mantle achieves a stable mechanical state.\
    -   Generates radial (hoop) stresses, placing the prosthesis, cement, and bone interface under compression.\
-   **Load Dissipation**: More evenly around the stem.\
-   **Features**:
    -   Highly polished, tapered design.

### Cemented Stem Failure

#### Failure Mechanism

-   Crack formation at the **cement–stem interface** (microfractures).\
-   Inadequate stem stiffness → bending → crack propagation.\
-   **Cement**: Non-biologic fixation; cracks spread to the **cement–bone interface**, leading to loosening.

#### Composite Beam Failure

-   Micromotion between cement and stem.\
-   Debris generation.\
-   Cement fracture and crack propagation.

#### Taper Slip Stem Failure

-   **Stable inherently**, but rotational motion poses a risk.\
-   **Axial Loading**: Sudden hoop stresses from events like falls can cause fractures.\
-   **Bone Vulnerability**: Anisotropic properties of bone exacerbate the risk.
