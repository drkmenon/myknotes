### Factors Influencing the Rate of Head Fractures

1.  **Quality of Impaction**
    -   Performed along the axis of the neck of the prosthesis on a clean Morse taper.
    -   Persistent tissue debris or a damaged Morse taper surface (e.g., scratches) can reduce static fracture load to **20%** of its normal value.
2.  **Cleanliness of the Morse Taper During Impaction**
    -   A clean, undamaged taper is essential to prevent fracture.
3.  **Diameter of the Femoral Head**
    -   **Advantages of Larger Head Diameters:**
        -   Reduced risk of impingement between the neck and the rim of the ceramic liner or metal cup.
        -   Increased range of motion.
        -   Decreased risk of dislocation.
    -   **Problems with Larger Head Diameters (\>36 mm):**
        -   Positive offset develops as the head center moves outside the cup center, reducing head coverage angle.
        -   Edge loading occurs during micro-separation phases (inevitable during walking).
        -   Increased friction between bearing couple elements leads to noise (squeaking).
        -   Potential ceramic surface modification, though the impact on fracture rates remains unknown.

### Liner Fracture

#### Contributing Factors:

1.  **Implantation Techniques**
2.  **Cup Design**
3.  **Functional "Limits" During Edge Loading**

#### Specific Issues with Cup and Liner:

1.  **Thin Liners:**
    -   Liners that are too thin are more prone to fractures, especially in 50-54 mm diameter cups.
2.  **Cup Design:**
    -   Cup diameter and thickness indirectly affect liner impaction quality.
    -   Narrow Morse taper angles (\<10Â°) complicate insertion, increasing peripheral stresses.
    -   Recent cups with longer Morse tapers (9 mm or 11 mm) aim to improve liner stability but present challenges with:
        -   Tissue interposition.
        -   Difficulties in cleaning the taper during minimally invasive procedures.
        -   Deformation of perforated, non-impermeable metal cups during impaction.
3.  **Insertion Issues:**
    -   Misaligned impaction can result in peripheral stress and chipped edges.
    -   Ceramic liners are rigid and cannot adapt to socket deformations, unlike polyethylene liners.

### National Joint Registry (NJR) Data: 13-Year Revision Rates in THR

| Fixation Type | Bearing Type | Revision Rate (\<55 years) | Revision Rate (\>55 years) |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Cemented | MoP | 10 | 4.5 |
| Cemented | CoP | 3.8 | 4.5 |
| Cemented | CoC | \- | \- |
| Uncemented | MoP | 7 | 6 |
| Uncemented | CoP | 4.5 | 4.5 |
| Uncemented | CoC | 6.5 | 5.5 |

### Key Recommendations

1.  **Fixation Preferences:**
    -   Most patients choose **cemented fixation** with hard-on-soft bearings.
2.  **Bearing Type Preferences:**
    -   Ceramic bearings are preferred over metal.
3.  **Patients Under 55 Years:**
    -   Consider discussing **dynamic fixation** using uncemented components.
4.  **Cup Design Considerations:**
    -   Ensure appropriate liner thickness and proper Morse taper alignment to minimize risks of fracture and edge loading.
