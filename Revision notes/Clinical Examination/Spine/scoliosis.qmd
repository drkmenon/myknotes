# History

### **Social History**

-   **Age:**
    -   How old are you?
-   **Education/Work:**
    -   Are you at school, college, or working? What is your job?

-   **Sports and Activities:**
    -   Do you play any sports or participate in physical activities?
-   **Career Aspirations:**
    -   What are your future plans or career goals?

### **Curve-Related Questions**

-   **Onset:**
    -   When did you first notice the curve?
-   **Progression:**
    -   Has it gotten bigger?
-   **Impact:**
    -   Does the curve bother you, cause pain, or affect walking, sports, school, work, or social activities?
-   **Previous Medical Attention:**
    -   Have you seen anyone about it before? Have you received any treatment?

### **Associated Problems**

-   **Neurologic Symptoms:**
    -   Do you experience any neurologic symptoms?
-   **Respiratory Symptoms:**
    -   Do you get short of breath?

### **Past Medical History**

-   **Birth History:**
    -   Were there any issues during birth or the neonatal period (e.g., SCBU/NICU admissions)?
-   **Developmental Milestones:**
    -   Were there delays in milestones?
-   **Maternal Perinatal Problems:**
    -   Any complications during your mother’s pregnancy?
-   **Other Medical Problems:**
    -   Have you been told about any other related conditions?
    -   Are there other issues you haven’t discussed with a doctor?

### **Skeletal Maturity**

-   **Menarche:**
    -   When was your first period?

## Examination

### **Look (Standing)**

-   **Front:**
    -   Shoulder, pelvic, ASIS, and waist asymmetry.
    -   Leg length discrepancy.
    -   Skin signs of spinal dysraphism (e.g., café-au-lait spots, hairy patches, neurofibromas).
-   **Side:**
    -   Sagittal alignment (normal cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine curves).
    -   Plumb line alignment (measured via X-ray).
-   **Back:**
    -   Coronal alignment (C7 to natal cleft deviation).
    -   Define curve pattern (e.g., right thoracic or left lumbar flexible).
    -   Rib hump (measure with scoliometer during Adams forward bending test).
    -   Skin stigmata or scars.

### **Feel (Standing)**

-   Palpate for pain along the spine.
-   Chest expansion (nipple level) – should be at least 7 cm.

### **Move (Standing)**

-   Assess range of motion (ROM) in all planes.
-   Observe gait:
    -   Pelvic tilt or shoulder dipping.
    -   Short leg gait.
    -   Trendelenberg gait.

### **Look (Sitting)**

-   Assess partial correction of the curve (indicates compensatory/flexible elements).

### **Look (Lying)**

-   Measure leg lengths (apparent and true discrepancy).

### **Feel (Lying)**

-   Perform a full neurologic examination:
    -   Reflexes.
    -   Abdominal reflexes.
    -   Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) signs (Babinski, clonus).

### **Move (Lying)**

-   Assess ROM of joints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finishing Steps

-   **Radiographs:**
    -   Obtain full-spine standing AP and lateral views.
-   **MRI:**
    -   If there are concerning features, order an MRI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scoliosis X-Ray Interpretation

### **Radiographs:**

-   Full spine (36-inch cassette), AP and lateral views, including hips.

### **Curve Assessment:**

-   **Pattern:**
    -   Identify the type of curve.
-   **Cobb Angle:**
    -   Measure using the endplates of the most angled vertebrae.
-   **Apical Vertebra:**
    -   Note the most displaced vertebra.

### **Rotation:**

-   Assess pedicles for rotation.
-   Determine whether spinous processes are visible between pedicles.
-   Identify whether curves are structural (malrotation in both curves).

### **Congenital Anomalies:**

-   Look for hemivertebrae or bars.

### **Skeletal Age:**

-   Check iliac crest ossification and triradiate cartilage closure.

### **Flexibility:**

-   Forward-bending views to assess curve flexibility.
