## **History**

1.  **Key point in history:**
    -   Differentiate between vascular and neurogenic stenosis.
    -   Ask about walking distance and difficulty walking, onset and progression of symptoms.

## **Look**

1.  **Stooped posture:**
    -   Observe for a kyphotic or flexed posture, especially when standing.
2.  **Elderly:**
    -   Note the age of the patient.
3.  **Scars over the back:**
    -   Check for previous surgical scars which might indicate a history of back surgery.

## **Feel**

1.  **Pain over lower back:**
    -   Assess for localized or radicular pain in the lumbar area.

## **Move**

1.  **Restricted Range of Motion (ROM):**
    -   Look for limited forward bending, extension, and lateral bending.
2.  **Gait:**
    -   Observe for a stooped, shuffling gait with a slow cadence.
    -   The patient may walk with minimal movement to avoid symptoms.
3.  **Lie Down**
    -   Perform a full neurologic examination to assess for any abnormalities.
    -   Ask the patient to perform a bicycle test (exaggerated lumbar extension while sitting on a stationary bike). Pain relief in this position suggests neurogenic claudication.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Perform to assess for sacral root involvement.
2.  **Vascular examination:**
    -   Check pulses in the legs, for color changes, and for any signs of peripheral vascular disease.
