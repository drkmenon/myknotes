## **Look**

1.  **General screening:**
    -   Check for scars post-discectomy, which may indicate previous surgery.

## **Feel**

1.  **Pain in back:**
    -   Palpate the lumbar spine for tenderness and trigger points.

## **Move**

1.  **Range of Motion (ROM) examination:**
    -   Assess for restricted movements, especially in flexion, extension, and lateral bending.
2.  **Walk:**
    -   Observe gait for any limp, altered stride, or compensation (e.g., limp on the affected side).

## **Lie Down**

1.  **Full Neurologic Examination:**
    -   Perform a detailed sensory, motor, and reflex assessment.
2.  **Include sciatic stretch tests:**
    -   **SLR (Straight Leg Raise):**
        -   Positive if pain radiates down the leg below the knee.
    -   **Lesagueâ€™s test:**
        -   Extension of the knee with hip flexion increases radicular pain.
    -   **Cross over test:**
        -   Positive if pain radiates on crossing the unaffected leg over the affected one.
    -   **Bowstring test:**
        -   Relief of pain when the leg is lowered after a positive SLR.
    -   **Femoral Stretch test:**
        -   Pain in the anterior thigh when extending the knee from a flexed position at the hip.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Check for sacral root involvement and bowel function.
2.  **Vascular:**
    -   Assess pulses, color, and temperature in the legs.
3.  **MRI:**
    -   Recommended for visualization of the herniated disc and surrounding structures.
