## Examination

### **Look**

-   **Walking Aids:**
    -   Observe for the use of crutches, braces, or other aids.
-   **Muscle Wasting:**
    -   Global wasting, with particular attention to the Quadriceps.
-   **Limb Length Discrepancy:**
    -   Assess for differences in leg length.
-   **Flexion Deformity of Knee:**
    -   Check for over-pulling by hamstrings.
-   **Foot Deformities:**
    -   Note any type of deformity (e.g., pes cavus or claw toes).
-   **Scars:**
    -   Inspect hips, knees, and feet for surgical or traumatic scars.
-   **Spine:**
    -   Check for scoliosis.
-   **Gait:**
    -   Look for:
        -   Asymmetric gait.
        -   Reduced cadence.
        -   Changes in foot progression angle.
        -   Trendelenberg gait (indicating abductor weakness).
        -   Quadriceps-deficient gait (knee hyperextension during stance phase).
        -   Foot drop.
        -   Compensatory movements at the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle.

### **Feel (Lying Down)**

-   **Pain:**
    -   Assess for tenderness or discomfort in affected areas.
-   **Sensory Examination:**
    -   Test dermatomes and peripheral nerves; sensory function is typically intact.
-   **Motor Power:**
    -   Assess strength in myotomes and peripheral nerves.
-   **Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) Signs:**
    -   Check for Clonus, Babinski sign, and altered reflexes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Move (Lying Down)**

-   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
    -   Evaluate ROM in all joints.
-   **Hip Dislocation:**
    -   Screen for any signs of dislocation.
-   **Correctibility of Deformities:**
    -   Test whether deformities can be corrected manually.

## Finishing Steps

-   Take a full history.
-   Document findings systematically.
