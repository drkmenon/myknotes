## **History**

1.  **Symptoms:**
    -   Difficulty in fine motor tasks (e.g., dropping things, clumsiness with buttons, using utensils).
    -   Walking difficulty, especially gait abnormalities (e.g., shuffling, broad-based, ataxic).
    -   Urinary or bowel issues.
    -   Neck or back pain.
    -   Radicular symptoms (pain radiating down the limbs).
    -   Are these symptoms progressive?
    -   Any systemic symptoms like weight loss?
    -   Any past treatment for similar episodes?
    -   Headaches?
2.  **Past Medical History (PMH):**
    -   History of cancers, strokes, cardiovascular disease.
3.  **Social History (SH):**
    -   Smoking history.
    -   Home circumstances.
    -   Support network.

## **Examination**

### **Look**

1.  **Ask the patient to expose fully to examine both upper and lower limbs.**
2.  **Walking Aids:**
    -   Note if the patient uses walking aids and their type.
3.  **Front, Side, and Back:**
    -   Check for scars, deformities, and muscle wasting.
4.  **Rhomberg’s Test:**
    -   Observe balance with eyes closed.
5.  **Stand on Heels:**
    -   Test for proprioception and gait stability.
6.  **Stand on Toes:**
    -   Check for strength and balance.
7.  **Heel-Toe Walk:**
    -   Assess coordination and gait pattern.
8.  **Hands for Intrinsic Wasting:**
    -   Look for muscle atrophy in the hands.
9.  **Feet and Legs for Wasting and Clawing:**
    -   Inspect for muscle wasting and foot drop.
10. **Gait:**
    -   Shuffling, broad-based, ataxic, unsteady, prolonged stance, reduced cadence.

### **Feel**

1.  **Pain:**
    -   Check for neck or back pain.
2.  **Sensory Examination:**
    -   Test dermatomes and peripheral nerves.
    -   Offer pin prick, soft touch, 2-point discrimination, and vibration testing.

### **Move**

1.  **Neck & Upper Limb:**
    -   Assess neck movements (flexion, extension, rotation).
    -   **Lhermitte’s Sign:**
        -   Flex neck to provoke electric shock sensation down the spine.
    -   **Spurling’s Test:**
        -   Compression of the cervical spine to elicit radicular symptoms.
    -   **Shoulder Abduction Relief Sign:**
        -   Positive if symptom relief with shoulder shrug.
    -   **Tone:**
        -   Check for spasticity.
    -   **Motor Power – Myotomes:**
        -   Test key muscle groups (C5, C6, C7, C8, T1).
    -   **Reflexes – Hyper-reflexia:**
        -   Check for exaggerated DTRs (e.g., biceps, triceps, brachioradialis).
    -   **Signs of Myelopathy – UMN Signs:**
        -   **Scapulohumeral Reflex:**
            -   Brisk humeral abduction on percussion of scapula spine.
        -   **Hofman’s Test:**
            -   Flicking the nail bed to elicit finger flexion.
        -   **Inverted Radial Reflex Sign:**
            -   Flexion of fingers when pressing on the radial styloid.
        -   **Ulna Finger Escape Sign:**
            -   Flexion of fingers with resistance during extension.
2.  **Lower Limb Examination:**
    -   Same steps as above for sensory, tone, power, and reflexes.
    -   **Tests for UMN Lesions in Lower Limb:**
        -   **Babinski Sign:**
            -   Positive if there’s an up-going plantar response.
        -   **Clonus:**
            -   5 beats is abnormal.
        -   **Hyper-reflexia:**
            -   Exaggerated reflexes in the lower limb.

### **Finishing**

1.  **Offer to do PR (Per Rectum) and assess perianal sensation if indicated.**
2.  **Vascular Examination:**
    -   Check for signs of vascular compromise.
3.  **X-Rays:**
    -   Full spine in neutral, flexion, and extension views.
4.  **MRI Scan:**
    -   To confirm diagnosis and assess for cord compression and neural involvement.
