## **Goals**

1.  Make the diagnosis.
2.  Establish the level of the lesion – strongly correlates with function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Examination**

### **Look (Standing if Possible)**

-   **Orthoses:**
    -   Observe for the presence and type of orthoses, which can indicate functional level.
-   **Catheter:**
    -   Presence of a catheter suggests a lower functional level.
-   **Muscle Wasting:**
    -   Assess for wasting in the lower limbs.
-   **Deformities:**
    -   Identify any visible limb deformities.
-   **Leg Length Discrepancy:**
    -   Measure for differences in leg length.
-   **Limb Hypoplasia:**
    -   Look for underdeveloped limbs.
-   **Hip Dislocation:**
    -   Check for signs of hip dislocation.
-   **Spine:**
    -   **Scoliosis:**
        -   Present in:
            -   90% of cases with thoracic-level lesions.
            -   20% of cases with L5 or below lesions.
    -   **Myelomeningocele:**
        -   Observe for evidence of repaired or open myelomeningocele.
    -   **Stigmata of Dysraphism:**
        -   Pits, hairy patches, café-au-lait spots, or other cutaneous markers.
-   **Feet:**
    -   Look for ulcers or pressure sores.
    -   Identify foot deformities.

### **Feel**

-   **Sensory Examination:**
    -   Quantify the level of sensory loss using dermatomal mapping.

### **Move**

-   **Tone:**
    -   Assess for spasticity or hypotonia.
-   **Motor Power:**
    -   Test muscle strength in all key groups.
-   **Reflexes:**
    -   Check deep tendon reflexes (DTRs).
-   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
    -   Assess ROM in the hips, knees, and ankles.
    -   Look for:
        -   Dislocations.
        -   Joint contractures.
        -   Spasticity.
        -   Arthrosis.

### **Gait**

-   Observe gait:
    -   With and without orthotics.
    -   Note any compensatory mechanisms or abnormal patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Finishing**

1.  Take a full history, focusing on developmental milestones and functional abilities.
2.  Correlate clinical findings with imaging (MRI/CT or spinal X-rays) to confirm the level of the lesion.
3.  Perform additional evaluations as needed, such as urodynamic studies or orthopedic imaging.
