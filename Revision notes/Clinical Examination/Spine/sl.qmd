## **Look Standing**

1.  **Front:**
    -   Symmetric pelvic and shoulder height.
2.  **Side:**
    -   Hyperlordotic lumbar spine or flattened lumbar spine.
    -   Short, sharp kyphosis.
3.  **Back:**
    -   Check for stigmata of dysraphism (e.g., Spina bifida).
    -   Look for heart-shaped buttocks, which can be due to a retroverted pelvis and vertical sacrum.
    -   Assess for scoliosis, which may be due to muscle spasm.
    -   Palpate the lower lumbar spine for a step deformity.

### **Feel Standing**

1.  **Pain:**
    -   Check for pain in the lower lumbar spine, paraspinal pain, and sacroiliac (SI) pain.
2.  **Step Deformity:**
    -   Identify any step deformity in the lower lumbar spine.
3.  **Paraspinal Pain:**
    -   Palpate for muscle spasms and tenderness in the paraspinal muscles.

### **Move Standing**

1.  **Range of Motion:**
    -   Global restricted lumbar spine movements.
    -   **Schober Test:**
        -   Reduced, indicating restricted flexion.
2.  **Gait:**
    -   Observe a waddling gait, often normal despite pathology.

## **Lying Down**

1.  **Assess Hamstrings Tightness:**
    -   Perform the Straight Leg Raise (SLR) or drop kick test.
2.  **Full Neurologic Assessment:**
    -   Sensory examination, tone, power, reflexes.

### **Finishing**

1.  **Perianal and PR Examination:**
    -   Check for perianal sensation and any abnormalities during a rectal examination.
2.  **Vascular Examination:**
    -   Ensure no signs of vascular compromise.
3.  **Radiographs:**
    -   Obtain AP, lateral, and oblique views.
4.  **Advanced Imaging:**
    -   MRI or CT scan to assess for soft tissue involvement, neural compression, and precise grade of spondylolisthesis.
