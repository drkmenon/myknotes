title: "Rheumatoid Cervical Spine"
---

## **Key Points**

-   Screen for myelopathy, impending myelopathy, and instability.
-   Focus on detecting signs that may indicate cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

## **History**

1.  **Neck pain:**
    -   Check for chronic or recent onset.
2.  **Occipital headaches:**
    -   Often related to RA-induced neck issues.
3.  **Change to walking:**
    -   New clumsiness, gait changes, or difficulty with balance.
4.  **Functional deterioration:**
    -   Difficulty with activities such as dressing or typing.
5.  **Urinary or bowel disturbance:**
    -   May indicate severe involvement affecting the cervical spine.
6.  **Past treatment:**
    -   Details on previous RA treatments, including medication and biologics.
7.  **Co-morbidities:**
    -   Other medical conditions affecting RA (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).

## **Examination**

### **Look**

1.  **General features of appearance related to rheumatoid:**
    -   Observe for any signs of severe RA (e.g., deformities in hands).
2.  **Hands:**
    -   Look for wasting, deformities, or changes that may be RA-specific (e.g., Swan neck deformity).

### **Feel**

1.  **Neck pain:**
    -   Palpate for tenderness, step deformity, or signs of atlantoaxial instability.
2.  **Sensation in upper limbs:**
    -   Check for any neuropathy related to RA (e.g., median nerve involvement).

### **Move**

1.  **Neck ROM (Range of Motion):**
    -   Reduced neck rotation, flexion, and extension can indicate cervical spine involvement.
2.  **Gait:**
    -   Observe gait for signs of a myelopathic gait (e.g., shuffling, broad-based, or ataxic gait).

### **Upper Limb Full Neurologic Exam**

1.  **Tone, power, reflexes:**
    -   Assess the upper limbs for any signs of weakness, clumsiness, or muscle wasting.
2.  **Myelopathy signs:**
    -   **Hofman's sign:** Rapid flicking of the index and thumb causes thumb adduction.
    -   **Scapula tap:** Tap on the scapula causes shoulder abduction and elbow flexion.
    -   **Inverted radial reflex:** An outward flicking motion of the thumb when lightly flicked.
    -   **Hyperreflexia:** May indicate spinal cord involvement.

### **Feel Lie Down**

1.  **Full Lower Limb Examination:**
    -   Sensory, motor, and reflex assessments.
    -   Check for signs of spasticity or clonus.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Assess for sacral root involvement affecting bowel and bladder function.
2.  **Vascular Exam:**
    -   Look for signs of vascular insufficiency affecting the cervical spine.
3.  **X-rays:**
    -   AP (Antero-Posterior) and Lateral views to assess for joint destruction and stability.
4.  **MRI of Cervical Spine:**
    -   For detailed visualization of soft tissue changes, spinal cord compression, and instability.
