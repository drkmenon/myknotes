## Look (Standing)

-   **General Appearance:**
    -   Male, middle-aged adult.
    -   Head translated forwards.
    -   Decreased horizontal gaze.
    -   "Question mark" posture.
    -   Loss of cervical and lumbar lordosis.
    -   Kyphotic deformity of the thoracic spine.
    -   Flexed attitude of hips and knees.
-   **Eyes:** Check for uveitis.

## Feel (Standing)

-   **Pain:**
    -   Over sacroiliac joints (SIJ).
    -   Throughout the spine (indicative of Romanus lesions or pseudoarthrosis).
-   **Chest Expansion:**
    -   Measure at the nipple level; should be at least 7 cm.

## Move (Standing)

-   **Walking Assessment:**
    -   Observe gaze pattern while walking.
    -   Assess for hip or knee flexion contractures.
-   **Stiff Cervical Spine:**
    -   Measure forward gaze angle.
    -   Assess chin-brow angle.
    -   Check for absence of lateral bend.
    -   Measure occiput-to-wall distance.
-   **Stiff Thoracic Spine:**
    -   Inability to flatten the back against a wall.
    -   Loss of rotation with pelvis fixed.
-   **Stiff Lumbar Spine:**
    -   Reduced flexion on Schober's test.

## Lie Down

-   **Posture:**
    -   Unable to rest head back without pillows.
-   **Tests:**
    -   Perform FABER test for sacroiliitis.
    -   Assess the range of motion (ROM) in hips and knees for any fixed flexion.

## Finishing Steps

-   Conduct a full neurologic and vascular examination.

## History

-   Gather a detailed history relevant to ankylosing spondylitis.

## Imaging

-   Order X-rays to confirm diagnosis and assess structural changes.
