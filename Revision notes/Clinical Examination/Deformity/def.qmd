# Examination of a Lower Leg Angular Deformity

## Look

-   **Overall appearance**: Comment on obesity or short stature.\
    Ask to document height and weight on a growth chart.\
-   **Scars**: Look for scars from past surgery.\
-   **Deformity**: Comment on the deformity from the front, side, and back.\
-   **Spine**: Comment on the spine from the back.\
-   **Focus**: Is it obvious where the deformity is?

## Walk

-   Observe for:
    -   Varus or valgus thrust\
    -   Waddling\
    -   Antalgic gait

## Feel

-   Measure intermalleolar distance with knees together and patellae facing forward.

## Lie Down

-   **Square pelvis**: Check alignment.\
-   **Measure deformity**:
    -   ASIS to medial malleolus (Tibia).\
    -   Use a goniometer at the knee for crude measurements.\
-   **Correctibility**: Assess if deformities are correctable.

## Move

-   **Range of Motion (ROM)**: Assess in the joints.\
-   **Rotational Profile**: Evaluate rotational alignment.

## Finishing

-   **Imaging**:
    -   Full-limb standing X-rays with the emitter at 3m, centered on knees.\
    -   CT scanograms.\
-   **Family history**: Take a detailed family history.

# Examination of a Leg Length Discrepancy

## Standing

### Look

-   **Discrepancy**: Check for any obvious discrepancy.\
-   **Trunk/Pelvis**: Look for pelvic tilt or trunk lean.\
-   **Posture**: Observe for flexion posture in the long leg or equinus in the short leg.\
-   **Spine**: Assess for scoliosis using a forward bend test and note correction (compensatory).\
-   **Feet**: Check for fusions or deformities.\
-   **Other signs**: Look for scars, swellings, or angular deformities.

### Feel

-   Place fingers on ASIS with knees extended and feet flat to assess difference.\
-   Perform a block test until the pelvis is square (functional discrepancy).

## Move

-   **Gait**:
    -   Observe and comment on gait patterns, such as short leg gait, ipsilateral knee flexion, contralateral ankle equinus, circumduction, hip hitching, or trunk bending.

## Lie Down

### Look

-   Observe for any additional findings.

### Feel

-   Square up the pelvis and palpate the ASIS.\
-   Measure **true** and **apparent discrepancy**.

### Move

-   Perform:
    -   **Thomas test**: Assess hip flexion contractures.\
    -   **Hip ROM**: Evaluate for contractures.\
    -   **Galleazzi test**: Determine femoral or tibial discrepancy.
        -   If femoral: Use Nelaton's line and Bryan's triangle for further assessment.

## Finishing

-   **Other examinations**:
    -   Examine upper limbs.\
    -   Examine chest and abdomen for anomalies.\
-   **Imaging**:
    -   Full-length X-rays for a detailed view.
