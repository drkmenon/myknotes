## Inspect
- **Wasting**: Observe for muscle atrophy.  
- **Scars**: Look for surgical or injury-related scars.  
- **Deformity**: Assess for visible abnormalities.  

## Walk
- Check for **ACL deficiency gait**.  

## Lie Down
- **Range of Motion (ROM)**: Assess joint movement.  
- **Screen for Sag**: Look for posterior sag (PCL assessment).  
- **Posterior Draw Test**: Evaluate posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) integrity.  
- **Quads Active Test**: If PCL laxity is present, observe tibial movement during quadriceps contraction.  
- **Lachman Test**: Assess anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) integrity.  
- **Collateral Ligaments**:  
  - Varus and valgus stress tests.  
- **Pivot Shift**: Dynamic test for ACL laxity.  
- **Dial Test**: Assess for posterolateral corner injuries.

## Finishing
- **Joint Lines and Menisci**: Palpate for tenderness and check for meniscal involvement.  
- **Pulses and Neurology**: Evaluate vascular and nerve function.  
- **Full History**: Gather a complete patient history.  
- **Imaging**: Order appropriate imaging for confirmation (e.g., MRI, X-ray).

# Pivot Shift Quantification
- **Grade 1**: Glide.  
- **Grade 2**: Clunk.  
- **Grade 3**: Gross clunk with locking.  
- In extension, the tibia starts anteriorly subluxated.  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - Valgus force tensions the MCL.  
  - During flexion, the knee pivots around the MCL.  
  - The ITB moves posterior to the knee's center of rotation (COR), working as a flexor, reducing the tibia with a clunk.

# Lachman Test Quantification
- **Position**: Perform at 30° flexion when ACL is most lax.  
- **Grades**:  
  - **Mild**: 0–5 mm translation.  
  - **Moderate**: 6–10 mm translation.  
  - **Severe**: >10 mm translation.  
- **Comparison**: Always compare with the contralateral knee to determine normal.  
- **End Point**: Assess the quality of the end point.  
- **KT 1000 Testing**:  
  - Translation of 11 mm or a Lachman delta of 3 mm is diagnostic.  
  - High-grade laxity may indicate associated MCL or posterior horn medial meniscus tears.

# PCL Sag Sign
- **Grades**:  
  - **Grade 1**: Tibia still in front of femoral condyles.  
  - **Grade 2**: Tibia level with condyles.  
  - **Grade 3**: Tibia sagged behind condyles.

# Collaterals
- **Varus Opening**:  
  - At **0°**: Suggests LCL and PLC injury (high likelihood).  
  - At **30°**: May indicate isolated LCL injury (uncommon).
