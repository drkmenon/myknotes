## History

### Baseline Questions
- **Age**: Record the patient's age.  
- **Employment**: Document their job or occupation.  
- **Home Circumstances**: Note living conditions, support systems, and accessibility.  

### Details of Amputation
- **When**: Record the date of the amputation.  
- **Why**: Determine the cause (e.g., trauma, vascular disease, congenital, infection).  
- **Operations**: Ask if there have been multiple surgeries on the stump.  
- **Complications**: Inquire about post-operative issues, such as infection or delayed healing.  

### Current Symptoms
- **Pain**:  
  - **Stump Pain**: Nature, onset, relieving factors, and analgesics used.  
  - **Phantom Pain**: Frequency, nature, and treatment.  
  - **Night or Rest Pain**: Assess severity and impact on sleep.  
- **Neurologic Symptoms**: Evaluate sensations like tingling or numbness in the stump.  
- **Infection**:  
  - Presence of discharge, redness, swelling, or systemic symptoms.

### Prosthetic History
- **Prostheses**:  
  - How many prostheses has the patient used?  
  - Why were they changed?  
  - What is currently in use?  
- **Comfort**: Is the prosthesis comfortable and functional?

### Functional Level
- **Current Function**: Assess the patient's capabilities and limitations:  
  - Sports, walking, climbing stairs, self-care, and driving.  
- **Changes**: Has functional ability recently improved or declined?  
- **Satisfaction**: Is the patient satisfied with their current functional status?  
- **Problems**: Identify specific issues the patient wishes to address.

### Additional History
- **Past Medical History (PMH)**: Review for conditions relevant to amputation or prosthetic use.  
- **Drug History**: Document medications, especially those for pain or infection.  
- **Family History**: Investigate genetic or congenital causes if relevant.

## Examination

### Look
- **Orthoses and Aids**: Note any orthoses, prostheses, or use of wheelchairs.  
- **General Mobility**: Observe how the patient moves around the room.  
- **Stump Examination**:  
  - **Scars**: Check for redness, swelling, sinuses, or discharge.  
  - **Muscle Wasting**: Assess proximal muscle groups.  
  - **Stump Shape**: Look for pressure areas or abnormal contours.  

### Feel
- **Warmth**: Detect signs of inflammation or infection.  
- **Collections**: Palpate for fluid accumulations.  
- **Sensitivity**: Assess for tenderness or pain.  
- **Tissue Tethering**: Check if soft tissues are adhered to the bone.  

### Move
- **Range of Motion (ROM)**:  
  - Evaluate active and passive movement of proximal joints.  
  - Note any stiffness or pain.  

### Gait Assessment in Prosthesis
- Observe gait mechanics while the patient is using their prosthesis.  
- Look for asymmetry, compensatory movements, or discomfort.
