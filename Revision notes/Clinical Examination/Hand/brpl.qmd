title: "Brachial Plexus Examination"
---

### Inspection

-   **Posture:** Observe for any abnormal postures or deformities of the shoulder, arm, or hand.
-   **Muscle Wasting:** Assess for any visible muscle atrophy, particularly in the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand muscles.
-   **Fasciculations:** Look for involuntary muscle twitching, which may indicate nerve irritation.
-   **Scars:** Note any surgical scars, especially in the neck, shoulder, axilla, or arm.
-   **Horner's Syndrome:** Check for ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, which may indicate sympathetic nerve damage.

### Palpation

-   **Bony Landmarks:** Palpate the clavicle, scapula, and humerus for any tenderness, deformity, or crepitus.
-   **Muscle Tone:** Assess muscle tone and bulk by palpation.

### Sensation

-   **Dermatomes:** Test sensory function in the following dermatomes:
    -   C4: Shoulder
    -   C5: Lateral upper arm
    -   C6: Lateral forearm and thumb
    -   C7: Middle finger
    -   C8: Medial forearm and little finger
    -   T1: Medial upper arm

### Motor Function

-   **Root Level:**
    -   **Dorsal Scapular Nerve:** Test rhomboid muscle function by asking the patient to retract the scapula.
    -   **Long Thoracic Nerve:** Test serratus anterior muscle function by asking the patient to push against a wall with outstretched arms.
-   **Trunk Level:**
    -   **Suprascapular Nerve:** Test supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle function by assessing shoulder abduction and external rotation.
-   **Cords and Branches:**
    -   **Axillary Nerve:** Test deltoid muscle function by assessing shoulder abduction.
    -   **Musculocutaneous Nerve:** Test biceps muscle function by assessing elbow flexion.
    -   **Radial Nerve:** Test triceps, brachioradialis, and wrist extensor muscles.
    -   **Median Nerve:** Test thumb opposition, index finger flexion, and sensation in the lateral palm and digits.
    -   **Ulnar Nerve:** Test finger abduction and adduction, and sensation in the medial palm and digits.

### Special Tests

-   **Tinel's Sign:** Percuss over the nerve to elicit paresthesia.
-   **Phalen's Test:** Flex the wrists for 60 seconds to reproduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Note:** This is a general examination guide. Specific tests and maneuvers may vary depending on the clinical presentation and suspected nerve involvement.
