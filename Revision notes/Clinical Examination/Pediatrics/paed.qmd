## **Spina Bifida**
### Examination
#### Look
- Legs, feet, spine, orthoses, wheelchair.
  - **L4**: Community ambulators with an AFO.
  - **L5**: Typically do not require orthoses.
  - **L2**: May require a KAFO.
- Assess gait with and without orthoses.
- Describe deformities, wasting, or ulcers.
- Check for healed ulcers and cutaneous manifestations (hair tufts, pits, café-au-lait spots).
- Observe for scoliosis.

#### Feel
- **Sensory Examination**: Determine the lowest functional level.

#### Move
- Assess hips for dislocation.
- Passive ROM in joints.
- Evaluate tone and motor power to establish the motor level.
- Check the power of individual muscle groups in the feet.

## **Cerebral Palsy**
### History
#### Background & Developmental History
- **Age** and date of diagnosis.
- **Birth and pregnancy history**: Assess developmental milestones (sitting, walking, talking).

#### Chronic Problems
- Spine, hips, knees, feet.

#### History of Treatments
- **Orthotics**: Walking aids, braces, AFOs, wheelchair, sitting support.
- **Medications**: Baclofen, Botox, neuroleptics (e.g., for epilepsy), current medications.
- **Surgery**: Addressing spine, hips, knees, feet, upper limbs, and contracture release.

#### New and Current Problems
- Assess functional level and limitations (walking, sitting, sleeping, self-care, feeding).
- Identify problematic deformities.

#### Social Circumstances
- **Home Help**: Home modifications, schooling.
- **Self-Care**: Catheter use, intermittent catheterization.

#### Past Medical History
- Notable issues, especially epilepsy.

### Examination
#### Look
- Walking aids, wheelchair, seating support.
- Presence of an intrathecal baclofen pump.
- Posture at rest:
  - **Head**: Position.
  - **Upper Limbs**: Position.
  - **Balance**: Sagittal and coronal.
  - **Lower Limbs**: Contractures.
- Feet: Hallux valgus, cavus, ulceration, plantar callosities.
- Spine: Coronal and sagittal balance, scars.
- Gait: Describe systematically (head, shoulders, trunk, hips, knees, feet, gait phases, and foot progression angle).

#### Feel & Move
- Assess spine (standing): Forward bend test to display rib hump.
- **Supine**:
  - Pelvic obliquity, measure leg lengths.
  - Passive ROM in joints to quantify contracture:
    - Hips: Dislocation, ROM, pain, fixed flexion deformity (Thomas test).
    - Knees: Hamstring contracture, popliteal angle.
    - Feet: Gastrosoleus contracture, forefoot deformities (Silverskiold test).
- **Prone**:
  - Rotational profile: Femoral version, Gage’s test, thigh-foot angle.
  - Staheli test for FFD.
  - Ely test for rectus femoris contracture.
- **Side**:
  - Ober’s test for ITB tightness.

## **Achondroplasia**
### Examination
#### Look
- **Face/Head**: Frontal bossing, flattened midface, button nose.
- **Stature**: Short stature with normal trunk and rhizomelic shortening of the arms.
- **Elbows**: Decreased ROM, radial head dislocation.
- **Hands**: Brachydactyly, trident hands.
- **Spine**: Lumbar hyperlordosis, kyphosis.
- **Legs**: Genu varum, coxa valga.

#### Other Tests
- Assess the spine for stenosis (lumbar, foramen magnum).

---

## **Multiple Hereditary Osteochondromatosis**
### Examination
#### Keys
- Lump characteristics: Sessile or pedunculated, hard, non-expansile, pain-free/painful.
- Location: Adjacent to joints, with no skin changes.
- Neurovascular assessment distal to the lesion.
- Limb length or angular deformity: Offer to measure supine.
- Look for additional osteochondromas in other regions (pelvis, knees, spine).
- Symptoms: Mechanical or malignancy-related (e.g., growth, night pain).

#### Management
- Excise suspicious or mechanically bothersome lesions.
- Delay excision until maturity if possible.
