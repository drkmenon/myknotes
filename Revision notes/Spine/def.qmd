## Adult Scoliosis

### Definition
- **Scoliosis (>10-degree curve)** diagnosed after skeletal maturity
- **Mean age**: 60 years
- **Men = Women**

### Aetiology
1. **Idiopathic**: Remnant of undiagnosed AIS (Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis)
2. **De Novo**:
   - **Degenerative** (most common)
   - **Pathologic**
   - **Traumatic**
   - **Iatrogenic**
   - **Neuromuscular**

### Classification
#### Idiopathic Adult Scoliosis
- Based on location of curve & degree of sagittal & coronal imbalance

#### Degenerative Scoliosis
- **Type 1**: No rotational element
- **Type 2**: Rotational element
- **Type 3**: Sagittal or coronal plane imbalance (plumb line)
  - Each has a subtype +/- neurologic symptoms

### Clinical Presentation
- **Back pain** is more common in adults with scoliosis
  - Not usually severe
- **Neurologic symptoms** not common but can occur:
  - Stenosis (concavity of curve)
  - Radiculopathy
- **Cosmetic deformity**
- **Cardiopulmonary problems** (thoracic curves >70 degrees)
  - Mortality possible with curves >90 degrees

### Curve Patterns
- **Idiopathic** – remnant of AIS:
  - **Right Thoracic** most common
- **De-Novo (degenerative)**:
  - **Lumbar/Thoracolumbar curves**:
    - Lower magnitude
    - Fewer levels involved
    - No real pattern

### Progression of Curve
- **1 degree per year** for thoracic curves >50 degrees
- **0.5 degrees per year** for thoracolumbar curves
- **0.25 degrees per year** for lumbar curves

#### Risk Factors for Progression
- Curves >30 degrees
- Younger patients
- Right thoracic curves

### Diagnosis
#### History
- **Pain** – does it correlate to scoliosis?
- **Neurologic symptoms**
- **Curve progression**
- **Functional impairment**

#### Examination
- **Neurology**
- **Forward & side bending** – do curves correct?
- **Which are structural/compensatory?**

#### X-Rays
- **36-inch cassette XR AP & lateral**
- **Plumb line** to assess sagittal & coronal balance:
  - Should pass just anterior to sacrum from C7
- **Forward and Side bending views**
- **Structural and compensatory curves** (primary & secondary)
- **Are curves flexible?** i.e., do they need release before correction?

#### Lieberman J (2009) AAOS Comprehensive Review
- **Sagittal plane plumb line** should be 1-2cm anterior to anterior sacrum:
  - Increase = positive balance, decrease = negative balance
- **Coronal plane balance** should be within 2cm of centre of sacrum

#### MRI
- Assess neural structures

### Management
- **Mainstay is non-surgical**:
  - Physiotherapy, education, analgesia & activity modification

#### Surgical
- **Indications**:
  - Intractable pain
  - Neurologic deficit
  - Cardiopulmonary compromise
  - Significant gait disturbance
  - Cosmesis (relative)
  - Curve >50 degrees in younger patients – more time to progress
  - Curve >70 degrees in older patients

#### Goals
- Pain relief
- Solid fusion
- Spinal balance

#### Techniques
- **Posterior instrumented fusion** between normal vertebrae
  - In thoracic curves, better to sacrifice proximal levels and spare distal levels
  - Don’t stop fusion at thoracolumbar junction – leads to kyphosis
- **Consider 2-stage surgery** if curves rigid
- **Consider anterior supplementation** for large curves (>70 degrees)

##### 2-Stage Surgery +/- Supplementary Anterior Fusion
- **For large curves (>70 degrees)**
- **Rigid curves** as demonstrated by side bending X-rays
- **Lumbar curves**
- **Anterior fusion only** is possible for milder thoracolumbar curves:
  - Reduces the number of levels to fuse – stop at neutral rather than horizontal vertebra

##### Fusion to Sacrum
- **Necessary in large lumbar deformities**
- **Associated spondylolisthesis at L5/S1**
- **Rigid curve requiring anterior lumbar release**
- **Problems**:
  - Higher pseudoarthrosis rate
  - Pain
  - Instrumentation failure
  - Loss of lordosis

##### Sacropelvic Fusion
- **With iliac screws**
- **Consider if sacrum included in a long fusion**
- **Stabilises sacrum further**

##### Osteotomy
- **For rigid kyphotic deformity**
- **Pedicle subtraction or Smith-Peterson anterior opening wedge**
- **Higher complication rate**

### Overall Complications
- **Higher in older patients**, patients where sacrum included & larger curves
- **Pseudoarthrosis** (most common: 5-20%):
  - Occurs most at junctional levels (T12/L1 & L5/S1)
- **Infection**
- **Bleeding**
- **UTI**
- **Metalware failure**
- **Neurologic compromise** (1-5%)

## Kyphosis

### Aetiology
- **Most often thoracic spine** but may occur anywhere, especially at junctional levels
- **Idiopathic, Post-traumatic, Osteoporotic**

#### Idiopathic
- **Residual Scheuermann’s or congenital kyphosis**
- **Management**:
  - Surgical if non-operative treatment fails & symptoms severe
  - **Posterior instrumented fusion** of whole kyphotic segment
  - **Anterior release and fusion** if stiff curve:
    - Does not correct to at least 55 degrees on extension XR

#### Post-Traumatic
- **Post-fracture Rx non-operatively**
- **Post-instrumentation with failed fusion**
- **Post-laminectomy without fusion**:
  - Can cause pain & instability
  - Progressive kyphosis may occur
  - **Posterior corrective fusion with instrumentation**
  - **Add anterior decompression** if neurologic compromise

#### Osteoporotic
- **Single or multiple wedge compression fractures**
- Can be treated in the same way as above if very symptomatic
- **But due to osteoporosis, failure is much higher**
- **Complications all higher**
- **Kyphoplasty & Vertebroplasty**:
  - Good and equal short-term pain relief
  - Kyphoplasty meant to correct deformity as well
  - Long-term results not proven

### Corrective Osteotomy
- **An option for rigid & severe deformities (>70 degrees)**

#### Pedicle Subtraction Osteotomy
- **3-column osteotomy**
- **Up to 30-degree correction per level**
- **More neurologic risk**
- **Therefore preferred below conus where cord has ended**

#### Anterior Opening Wedge Smith-Peterson Osteotomy
- **Osteotomy through posterior column only** – more traditional method
- **Up to 10-degree correction per level**
- **Complications with all osteotomies are higher**, especially in:
  - Older patients
  - Multiple co-morbidities
  - Poor nutrition
  - Osteoporosis
