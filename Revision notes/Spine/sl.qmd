## Spondylolysis
- **Traumatic Pars defect** - unilateral
- **Common cause of pain in children & adolescents**
- **Fatigue fracture** from repeated hyperextension

### Associated with
- Ballet dancers
- Tight hamstrings
- Boys

### Diagnosis
- **Lateral XR** picks up 85%
- **Oblique** picks up 10% more
- **5% require CT, bone scan, or SPECT** (best)

### Management
- **Symptomatic relief & activity modification**
- **Bracing**
- **Non-union common but asymptomatic**
- **Surgery rarely indicated**

## Spondylolisthesis

### Classification
#### Type (Wiltse) – **D**ad **I**s **D**own **T**he **P**ub & **I**atrogenic
- **Type 1**: Dysplastic
- **Type 2**: Isthmic
  - **2a**: Pars stress fracture
  - **2b**: Elongated pars
  - **2c**: Acute pars fracture
- **Type 3**: Degenerative
- **Type 4**: Traumatic
- **Type 5**: Pathologic
- **Type 6**: Iatrogenic

#### Grade (Myerding)
- **Grade 1**: 0-25% slip
- **Grade 2**: 25-50% slip
- **Grade 3**: 50-75% slip
- **Grade 4**: 75-100% slip
- **Grade 5**: >100% slip (spondyloptosis)

### Radiographic Assessment of SL
- **Slip angle** – normal = <0
- **Sacral inclination** – normal = >30°
  - Alteration in both indicates kyphosis – poor prognostic factor
- **Pelvic incidence** – increase is related to increased progression

### General Presenting Features
- Pelvic waddle
- Heart-shaped bottom
- Palpable step
- Mechanical pain
- Neurologic symptoms

---

## Dysplastic Spondylolisthesis
- **Not strictly congenital** – develops by age 5
- **Girls > Boys**
- **Eskimos**

### Radiographic Features
- **L5/S1 level**
- **No pars defect** – intact neural arch
- **Dome-shaped S1**
- **Incompetent facet joint**
  - L5 inferior facet poorly formed, S1 superior facet absent
- **Trapezoidal L5**
- **>30% slip is uncommon**

### Clinical Features
- Patient presents during growth spurt most commonly
- **Slip usually <30%**
- **High rate of neurologic compromise** (cauda equina) with >30% slip
  - Intact neural arch

---

## Isthmic Spondylolisthesis
- **Most common type** (type 2a is most common, then 2b, then 2c)

### Pathology
- **Pars interarticularis stress fracture** – repeated hyperextension
- **Boys > Girls**
- **Eskimos**
- **Hyperextension sports**

### Associations
- Spina bifida
- Scheuermann’s

### Radiographic Presentation
- **L5/S1**
- **Sagittally orientated facets** but not dysplastic
- **Pars defect**
- **Usually <25% slip**

### Clinical Features
- **Uncommon for slip to progress** especially after skeletal maturity
- **Mechanical back pain**
- **Tight hamstrings**
- **Rare to get neurologic deficit**
  - High-grade slips
- **L5 exiting root** rather than traversing S1 is affected

### Risk Factors for Progression
- Girls
- Younger age at presentation
- High-grade slip
- **L4/5 or L3/4 slip**
  - Iliolumbar ligament stabilises L5/S1

---

## Adult Isthmic Spondylolisthesis
- **Present in 30’s usually**
- When an adolescent isthmic SL becomes symptomatic
- Due to degenerative process beginning with ageing
- **Mechanical pain** usually
- Sometimes **radicular or stenotic pain**
- **Pars defect** apparent on imaging

---

## Degenerative Spondylolisthesis
- **Older adults**
- **L4/5 most common level**

### Risk Factors
- Diabetes
- Blacks
- **Women > Men**
- Sacralised (transitional) L5

### Pathology
- **DDD with segmental instability**
- **Facet arthrosis**
- **Abnormal loading and mechanics**

---

## Management of Spondylolisthesis

### Low Grade (<50%)
- **Try non-operative treatment** whatever the case
  - Activity modification
  - Analgesia
  - Flexion exercises
  - Bracing in adolescents/children
- **Indication for surgery**:
  - Intractable pain
  - Neurologic deficit
  - Progression of slip

### High Grade (>50%)
- **In adolescents/children**:
  - **Prophylactic surgery** in children – high risk of progression
  - High risk of neurologic compromise, especially dysplastic
- **Adults with high-grade slips** tend to be symptomatic
  - Surgery is warranted as chance of progression higher
  - Results of surgery better than non-operative for high grade

---

## Surgical Treatment
- **Gold standard in all groups**:
  - **In situ posterolateral instrumented fusion**
    - Through a midline approach or Wiltse para-transverse approach
    - Favoured – less disruption to posterior structures
    - Low risk of neurologic compromise
    - Instrumentation increases fusion rate
      - Solid fusion associated with better outcome

### Controversies

#### Slip Reduction
- **Not for low-grade slips** – risk outweighs benefit
- **Indications**:
  - Significant L5/S1 kyphosis with hyperlordosis above
  - High slip angle (>45°)
  - Badly altered sagittal balance
- **Increases chance of neurologic injury** – 10% (most transient)
- **May decrease long-term chance of stenosis**
- **Reduction opens up and re-orientates foramina**

#### Anterior Supplementation
- **Should be considered for high-grade slips**
- Less stress on posterior instrumentation
- Higher chance of fusion
- **Anterior fusion alone does not work as well**

#### ORIF of Pars Defect
- **Tension band wiring or compression screw**
- **90% rate of union and good outcome**
- **Best results in**:
  - No DDD
  - Single-level slip
  - Low-grade slip
  - No neurologic deficit

## Management of Spondyloptosis
- **Extremely challenging surgery**
- **Usually done in a 2-stage procedure**:
  - **1st stage**: Removes L5
  - **2nd stage**: Fuses L4 to sacrum circumferentially
