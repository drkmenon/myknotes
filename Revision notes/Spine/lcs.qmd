## Epidemiology
- **Most common cause of spine surgery >60 years**
- **Men > Women**
- **Narrower canal between L3-L5**

## Aetiology
- **Acquired – common**:
  - **Degenerative** – most common
  - **Paget’s disease**
  - **Post-traumatic**
- **Congenital – uncommon**:
  - **Acromegaly**
  - **Achondroplasia**

## Pathophysiology
- **Mechanical compression** of neural elements within spine
- **Intraneural oedema**
- **Release of pain mediators** e.g., substance P

## Anatomic Factors
- **Contributing structures**:
  - **Trefoil-shaped canal**
  - **Congenitally narrow canal**
  - **Bony changes**:
    - Facet joint hypertrophy
    - Osteophyte formation
    - Subluxation/degenerative deformity
  - **Soft tissue**:
    - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
    - Disc herniation
    - Facet capsule hypertrophy

## Location of Stenosis
- **Central or lateral** (lateral recess, foraminal, extra-foraminal)

### Central (common)
- Within canal – anterior to flavum, posterior to PLL & medial to facet joint
- **Ligamentum flavum** is main offender

### Lateral Recess (less common)
- Just before the foramina – medial to pedicle but lateral to thecal sac

### Foraminal (less common)
- Within the exit foramina – between pedicles & in front of facet joint
- **Facet joint hypertrophy** is main offender
- **Normal foraminal height** = 25 x 9 mm

### Extra-foraminal (rare)
- Impingement of L5 root between sacral ala and L5 TP
- Related to scoliosis/spondylolisthesis
- Diagnosed using 25-degree caudal CT/MRI (Ferguson view)

## Diagnosis

### History – Typical
- **Pain** in buttocks and thighs radiating distally
- **Non-dermatomal**
- **Proximal to distal** in onset
- **Numbness**
- **Rarely, weakness or bladder disturbance** (late)
- **Related to standing or walking**
- **Relieved by sitting or lying down**
- **Easier with spine flexed**:
  - In extension, ligamentum flavum buckles into canal
  - Shopping trolley, uphill & up stairs easier

### Examination
- **Usually normal** including neurology & neural tension tests
- **Extension test positive**
- **Treadmill test** 90% sensitive
- **Bicycle test**
- **Always rule out other causes**:
  - PVD, malignancy, disc herniation

### Imaging
- **XR** as baseline
- **MRI/CT myelogram**:
  - Gold standard
  - Look carefully for foraminal & lateral recess stenosis

## Management
- **Natural history** is to improve in 30% with time
- **Steroids, NSAIDs & physio** do not alter natural history

### Surgery
- **Commonly performed**
- **Laminectomy with decompression** of flavum and medial aspect facets
  - Undercutting of facets to decompress lateral recess & foramina
- **Fusion only needed if**:
  - Wide decompression over multiple levels
  - Segmental instability
  - **Degenerative scoliosis** – in a younger patient
    - Degenerative scoliosis/spondylolisthesis in elderly tends not to be progressive even after surgery

### Results
- **Surgery has better short & medium-term results** than non-operative
- **Good for pain relief** – may leave numbness
- **Results decline** as degeneration continues

### Poor Indicators of Outcome
- Multiple co-morbidities
- Single-level surgery
- Long operative time
