## Physiotherapy
- Programs concentrate on:
  - **Aerobic exercise** - weight reduction & core strengthening
  - **Core stability** – transversus abdominis, multifidus, lumbar muscles
  - **Flexion exercises** – for those with stenotic symptoms
  - **Extension exercises** – for those with flexion/sitting pain (disc generated)
  - **Spinal mobilisation** – stretching of joints – release of contracture & synovium

## Chiropractic Care
- Stretches joints beyond their physiologic range – hear pop
- Not in those with stenosis or radiculopathy

## Evidence
- Both have reasonable evidence for acute pain
- Not of significant benefit in chronic back pain

## Epidural Steroids
- **Types**:
  - Translaminar
  - Transforaminal
  - Caudal
- Aim is to decrease inflammation around nerve roots – not for myelopathy
- May help in stenosis – temporary
- Diagnostic & therapeutic value
- Transforaminal shown to be most effective (nerve root injection)

## Facet Joint Injection & Denervation
- For lumbar back pain where facets are main pain generator
- No good way of diagnosing this for sure
- Usually have pain on rotation & extension
- Rule out other causes of back pain
- MRI may show facet joint high signal or degeneration
- Injection with dye to confirm – **dumbbell-shaped contrast** confirmatory
- RF ablation if injections work
- Denervates nerve supplying facet (middle branch of dorsal rami)

## Sacroiliac Injections
- Same principle as facet injections
- Rule out other spinal pathologies
- **Faber test** suggests SIJ pain

## Spinal Cord Monitoring
- Can be useful intra-operatively for high-risk procedures

### Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)
- Monitor peripheral nerves during surgery (median, ulnar, tibial, peroneal)

### Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials
- Monitor corticospinal tracts for motor tract changes

### EMG
- Dynamic, continuous EMG is the most common method
- Continuous reading created
- Can be monitored during key phases e.g. **pedicle screw insertion**
