## Location & Type
- **50% in C-spine**
- **Mean age**: 19 years old
- **Men > Women**
- **Incomplete quadriplegia** most common
- **Incomplete paraplegia** least common
- Only **1% of SCIs** have complete recovery in hospital

## Emergency Management
- **Above C5** – likely to need intubation

### Neurogenic Shock
- Loss of sympathetic – vasodilation; decreased SVR; bradycardia
- Need accurate fluid monitoring – Swan-Ganz on ICU

### Spinal Shock
- Flaccid areflexia
- Occurs with cord injury – not cauda equina injury
- Resolves within 48 hours usually
- No assessment regarding injury can be made till spinal shock resolves
- Heralded by return of **Bulbocavernosus reflex** (spinal reflex arc S1, 2, 3)
  - Absence occurs in spinal shock but not complete cord injury
  - May be absent in cauda equina, conus, or sacral injury

## Classification of SCI
- **Incomplete or Complete**
- Any sensation or motor power below the affected level = incomplete
- Sacral sparing often present in absence of motor power
- Level of injury described as the lowest normally functioning level
- **ASIA scoring system** classifies SCI (below)

### ASIA Classification
| **Injury** | **Features** |
|------------|--------------|
| **A**      | Complete – No sensory or motor function below level |
| **B**      | Incomplete – Sensory but no motor function below level |
| **C**      | Incomplete – Motor and sensory function below level; At least 50% key muscles below level have grade 2 or less power |
| **D**      | Incomplete – At least 50% key muscles below level have grade 3 or more power |
| **E**      | Normal Motor and Sensory function |

## Spinal Cord Injury Syndromes – Incomplete Patterns

### Central Cord Syndrome
- **Most common (10%)**
- Good prognosis for recovery
- Associated with hyperextension of a stenotic C-spine
- Predominantly upper limb motor weakness
  - Distal limb affected more than proximal (hands)
- Because upper limb neurons more central in corticospinal tracts
- Sensory involvement variable but usually minimal

### Brown-Sequard Syndrome
- **4% incidence**
- Best prognosis – 75% ambulate independently
- Penetrating injury
- Effectively a cord hemisection
- **Ipsilateral motor loss** (corticospinal tracts)
- **Ipsilateral proprioception, deep sensation & vibration loss** (dorsal column)
- **Contralateral pain, temperature, and light touch loss** (spinothalamic tracts)

### Anterior Cord Syndrome
- **2% of SCI**
- Due to injury of anterior spinal artery:
  - Traumatic – flexion axial load: artery pinched by bone/disc
  - Ischaemic – vascular occlusion in arteriopath
- Affects anterior 2/3 of cord
- Quadra or paraplegic with loss of pain & temperature sensation
  - Dorsal columns (proprioception, vibration, deep sensation) spared
- Appears very similar to a complete injury
- Poor prognosis – 10% are able to ambulate independently

### Posterior Cord Syndrome
- **Rare – 1% of SCI**
- Hyperextension injury
- Dorsal columns only (proprioception, vibration, deep sensation)

### Conus Medullaris Syndrome
- Conus is the termination of the cord
- Variable – T12-L2 (usually L1)
- Conus contains all the cell bodies of the lumbar & sacral roots
- Injury causes a mixed picture of upper and lower motor neuron symptoms
- Unusual pattern of motor and sensory loss is seen
- Affects all lumbar & sacral roots to some degree
- Bulbocavernosus reflex is absent

### Cauda Equina Syndrome
- Injury to the nerve roots outside the cord
- Lower motor neuron injury
- Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction are typical
- Sacral/saddle anaesthesia
- Bilateral symptoms

## Acute Management of SCI
- **Prevent secondary injury to cord**
  - Immobilise spine
  - Maintain oxygenation
  - Maintain normovolaemia
    - Aim for MAP 85mmHg
- Intubate and use invasive monitoring if necessary
- Diagnose & treat neurogenic shock

## Treatment of SCI

### Surgical Decompression & Stabilisation
- Traditional evidence says no difference in clinical results if decompression within 72 hours or within 5 days
- Non-clinical studies suggest decompression before 24 hours will give favourable outcome
- More recent RCT early results suggest decompression within 24 hours gives best results
- (Surgical Treatment for Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study – STASCIS)

### Hypothermia
- Managing patient at 33 degrees reduces secondary cord injury
- Retrospective studies only – weak evidence
- No prospective or randomized trials

### Methylprednisolone
- Evidence stems from National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS)
- Initially no difference with use of MP in terms of motor/sensory scores
- Post-hoc analysis showed:
  - MP (30mg/kg) within 8 hours of injury for 48 hours gave better neurologic function at 6 weeks and 6 months
  - No difference at 1 year
  - Also showed that rate of pneumonia, death, and sepsis higher in those given MP for 48 rather than 24 hours
- **Current Guidelines in US**
  - Recommends use of MP for 23 hours if given at under 8hrs from injury, as a possible treatment as long as care giver aware that evidence for complications is greater than evidence for its benefit

### Other Medical Therapies
- Several are in trial but results of high-quality studies are pending
- EPO; Anti-Nogo antibodies; Rho Antagonists etc.

## Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation

- **85% who survive first 24 hrs after SCI are alive at 10 years**
- **Leading causes of mid to long-term death**
  1. Sepsis – usually pulmonary
  2. Non-ischaemic heart disease
  3. Suicide

### Classification & Definitions of SCI
- **ASIA System** is universally accepted
- Most reliable 72 hours after injury when spinal shock should have resolved
- **A is worst and E is best**

| **ASIA A** | Complete SCI – no sensory or motor function & no sacral sparing |
| **ASIA B** | Incomplete – Complete motor loss but sensory sparing at some level |
| **ASIA C** | Incomplete - <50% muscles below the injury level have MRC power <3 |
| **ASIA D** | Incomplete - >50% muscles below level have MRC power >3 |
| **ASIA E** | Normal |

- **Sensory level**: Defined as the most cephalad level with normal pin prick and light touch
- **Motor level**: The most caudal level with MRC power 3 bilaterally as long as level immediately proximal is grade 5
- **Skeletal level**: Level at which the major bony injury exists
- **Neurologic level**: Most cephalic level with normal neurology bilaterally

## Acute Management of SCI
- **Prevent secondary injury**
- Maintain MAP 80
- Good Oxygenation
- Steroids – may be of benefit if within first 8 hours
- C-spine Protection

## Medical Complications in SCI

### Pulmonary
- Problems occur because of:
  - Shallow breathing
  - Inability to clear secretions
  - Atelectasis

### Cardiac
- Loss of sympathetic tone
- Bradycardia, flushing, sweating

### Thromboembolism
- 15-80% DVT
- PE 2-12%
- Usually before 3 weeks
- Prophylaxis required

### Bladder
- UMN causes spastic bladder – increased tone with retention or frequent emptying
- LMN causes loss of tone and retention with obstructive hydronephrosis
- Can cause recurrent UTI, pyelonephritis, renal stones, and kidney failure
- Intermittent or permanent catheterisation

### Bowel
- LMN causes incontinence – difficult to control
- UMN causes high tone bowel – need regular manual evacuations etc.

### Depression
- Frequent problem
- High suicide rate

### Skin
- Pressure sores are a constant problem
- Special mattresses and high vigilance required

### Musculoskeletal
- **Osteoporosis** from disuse
  - Fracture risk is high – difficult to fix – poor bone, deforming forces
  - Conservative management often appropriate
- **Heterotopic Ossification**
  - Most common around hip
  - Some degree in 50%, ankylosis in 5%

## Functional Outcomes in SCI
- Some motor recovery documented up to 2 years after injury
- Prognosis determined by degree of initial neurologic injury
- Best prognosis in <30 year olds (most patients <30yrs)
- Worst prognosis is with cord haemorrhage seen on MRI
- **90% of tetraplegics** will recover one root level of function
- **Complete paraplegics** generally do not recover function
- **80% of incomplete SCI** regain to MRC 3 or more in hip flexion & knee extension by 1 year
- Quicker recovery (<3 months) indicates better outcome
- Upper limbs tend to recover better than lower

### Outcome by Level of Injury
- **C6** is the level where function and independence vastly improves

| **C1-3** | If survive require respiratory assistance |
| **C4**   | Respiratory support early but may not require in long term; Need help with transfers & mobility; Need wheelchair with chin and head support |
| **C5 Quad** | Shoulder function intact; Can feed with special instruments; Need a powered wheelchair (can’t ambulate or transfer independently) |
| **C6 Quad** | Can transfer and dress independently; Can use a manual wheelchair; Can feed independently |
| **C7-8 Quad** | Manual Wheelchair; Independent feeding, dressing, manual wheelchair; Personal bowel and bladder care; Can drive a specialised van |

### Ambulation after SCI
- **90% with ASIA B** will be able to ambulate at time of discharge
- Motor incomplete better prognosis than sensory complete

## Tendon Transfer Surgery & Arthrodesis
- Priorities are to restore elbow flexion and wrist extension
- Allows hand to mouth and transfers plus self-propulsion of wheelchair
- **Wrist Fusion**
