## Epidemiology
- **Men > Women**
- **40-50 years onset**
- **Risk factors**:
  - Smoking
  - Manual labour
  - Driving

## Pathoanatomy
- **Ageing**:
  - Keratin Sulphate to Chondroitin Sulphate ratio of disc increases
  - Water content decreases
- **Leads to a cascade of**:
  - Loss of disc height – causes kyphosis
  - Disc herniation
  - Facet arthrosis
  - Subluxation (listhesis)
  - Ligament calcification (ALL/PLL) and hypertrophy (flavum)
  - Compensatory osteophyte formation:
    - Uncovertebral joints
    - Foramina
    - Anterior and posterior aspect of end plates

## Clinical Presentation

### History
- **Gradual onset**
- **Occipital headache**
- **Activity/position related pain** – extension & rotation
  - Flexion opens up canal & relieves symptoms
- **Radiculopathy**:
  - Unilateral dermatomal pain or weakness
  - Trapezius, upper back pain
- **Myelopathy**:
  - Clumsiness of hands – buttons, writing, eating
  - Gait disturbance – ataxic, broad-based
  - Burning/shooting pain up & down neck (Lhermitte’s sign)
- **Late & uncommon symptoms of myelopathy**:
  - Bladder/bowel dysfunction
  - Subjective weakness
  - Significant motor weakness – if in legs is late & worrying sign
- **Constant achy pain rare**
- **Radicular pain**

### Examination
- **Spurling’s Sign**:
  - For radiculopathy
  - Maximal extension & rotation towards side of symptoms replicates symptoms
    - Narrows exit foramina and impinges root further
- **Signs of Myelopathy**:
  - **Hoffman Reflex**: Flicking tip of middle finger = thumb IPJ flexion
    - May be present in people with normally brisk reflexes
  - **Babinski Sign**: Big toe elevation when sole stroked
    - False positive in infants
  - **Inverted Radial Reflex**: BR reflex causes finger flexion
  - **Gait**: Ataxia & broad-based stance
  - **Upper motor neuron signs**: Hyper-reflexia, clonus, spasticity
    - May have mixed picture with predominantly UMN in legs & LMN in arms

## Imaging

### X-Ray
- **70% of 70-year-olds** have asymptomatic XR changes
- **AP**:
  - Uncovertebral osteophytes, alignment
- **Lateral**:
  - Canal diameter - <14mm is relative stenosis; <10mm absolute
  - Torg Ratio (vertebral body/canal ratio) <0.8 = stenosis
  - Alignment – is spine kyphotic (limits treatment options)
- **Oblique**:
  - Foraminal stenosis
- **Flexion/Extension views**:
  - If instability suspected – usually stiff rather than unstable

### MRI
- Signal change in cord
- Neural compression
- **CT Myelogram** – for those who can’t have MRI – delineates OPLL better

## Management

### Axial Neck Pain
- **Non-operative where at all possible**:
  - Physio
  - Aerobic exercise
  - Weight loss
  - Isometric C-spine strengthening – decreases the neutral zone
  - Moist heat
- **Results of surgery unpredictable**

### Radiculopathy
- **Natural history of radiculopathy is good with non-operative treatment**
- **Indications for surgery**:
  - Progressive weakness
  - Intractable pain
  - Failure of non-operative treatment

### Myelopathy
- **No real place for non-surgical treatment**
- **Natural history shows stepwise deterioration with time**
- **Best results are while myelopathy is mild and present for short time**:
  - Aim is to halt progression, not restore neurology
  - Gait changes frequently do not resolve

## Surgical Options
- **Current evidence shows 3% yearly rate of adjacent level disease** whatever the index surgery
- **Decision-making should be based on which will give best symptomatic relief with lowest complications**

### Motion Sparing
- **Disc replacement**
- **Foraminotomy**
- **Laminoplasty**

### Motion Sacrificing
- **ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Fusion)**
- **Corpectomy & Fusion**
- **Laminoplasty & Fusion**

---

### Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Fusion (ACDF) / Anterior Corpectomy & Fusion
- **Gold standard** – first choice answer almost always
- **Allows direct decompression of all pathologic lesions**:
  - Disc
  - Uncovertebral osteophytes
  - Vertebra (corpectomy)
  - OPLL
- **Indirect decompression of foramina** by using allograft to restore lordosis
- **Results**: 90% symptom relief

#### Principles
- **Anterior approach**
- Remove disc and osteophytes
- Use allograft to restore lordosis (equal to autograft) & less morbidity
- Fusion improved with plating
- Use strut graft/cages if corpectomy done
- If >2 level surgery, consider supplementary posterior instrumentation
  - Modern systems may be ok up to 3 levels

#### Complications
- Recurrent & superior laryngeal nerves
- Oesophageal damage
- Pseudoarthrosis – often asymptomatic: leave alone
- Haematoma
- Neurologic complications <1% - rare

---

### Posterior Foraminotomy
- **Low morbidity**
- **For isolated radiculopathy** affecting one root due to foraminal stenosis
- **Foraminal osteophytes removed** to open up space for root
- **Not for myelopathy**
- **Not to be done if patient is kyphotic** – does not change alignment

---

### Disc Replacement
- **Same as ACDF approach and indications**
- **Preserves motion** by placing prosthesis
- **Unproven yet to alter course of adjacent level disease**
  - Comparable results to ACDF for symptom relief

---

### Laminectomy with or without Fusion
- **If a laminectomy is done, perform a fusion**
  - Avoids post-laminectomy kyphosis
  - Swan neck deformity (without fusion)
- **Easier surgery**
- **Less favourable results** as compared to other procedures
- **Not to be done if patient is kyphotic** – does not change alignment

---

### Laminoplasty
- **Lower morbidity and easier surgery** – C3 to C7 usually performed
- **Can be secured with laminoplasty plates**
- **Increases room for cord** – relieves symptoms
- **Maintains stability**
- **Not indicated if axial pain present** as no fusion is performed

#### Complications
- Recurrent myelopathy
- Stiffness – autofusion occurs
- C5 root damage
- **Not to be done if patient is kyphotic** – does not change alignment

---

### Combined Anterior & Posterior Approaches
- **If multilevel surgery is performed**
- **Consider if >2 and certainly >3 levels**
  - Especially if multilevel corpectomy
- **Supplements anterior instrumentation** while graft consolidates
- **HALO does not adequately immobilise sub-axial spine**

---

## OPLL (Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament)
- **Potential cause of myelopathy**
- **More common in Oriental Asians**
- **Unknown aetiology** but:
  - Genetic, occupational, dietary (high salt intake), diabetes, obesity implicated
- **Narrows space for cord**
- **Predisposes to myelopathy after extension injuries**
- **XR shows ossification posterior to the vertebral body only**
- **Mainly affects C Spine**

### Surgery for OPLL
- **Anterior or posterior**
- **Posterior may be safer** than trying to excise OPLL tethered to cord

---

## Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH)
- **Ossification of the Anterior Longitudinal Ligament**
- **Forrestier’s disease** is isolated ALL ossification
- **DISH includes ALL ossification as well as other skeletal hyperostoses**
- **Typically affects lower thoracic spine** but may be in cervical or lumbar
- **Ossification is actually along anterolateral aspect of bodies on axial CT**
  - Looks similar to ankylosing spondylitis

### Differentiated by:
- **Sparing of Facet joints**
- **Sparing of SI joints**

### Diagnostic Criteria for DISH
- **Bridging syndesmophytes across 4 contiguous vertebrae (3 disc spaces)**
