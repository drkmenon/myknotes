# Avascular Necrosis of the Hip

## Pathophysiology

-   **Final common pathway is microvascular coagulation**, leading to:
    -   Venous congestion
    -   Retrograde arterial occlusion
-   **Exact mechanism for each risk factor is unknown**

## Causes

**Common Causes:**

1\. **Corticosteroids** – Most frequent

2\. **Post Traumatic**

3\. **Alcohol**

4\. **Sickle cell disease**

5\. **Caissons disease**

**Uncommon Causes:**

1\. **Irradiation**

2\. **Smoking**

3\. **HIV**

4\. **Pregnancy**

5\. **Coagulopathies**

6\. **Inflammatory conditions (e.g., SLE)**

7\. **Statins**

\- **Many others**: Types of viruses or any state causing increased cortisol

## Classification and Management Factors

**Ficat System:**

1\. **Stage 1**: XR normal, AVN on MRI (pre-collapse)

2\. **Stage 2**: Sclerosis and cyst formation (pre-collapse)

3\. **Stage 3**: Subchondral collapse (crescent sign)

4\. **Stage 4**: Extensive femoral head collapse & acetabular degeneration

**Steinberg Classification (Modification of Ficat):**

1\. **Stage 0**: Normal XR, MRI & Bone Scan

2\. **Stage 1**: Normal XR, Abnormal MRI or Bone Scan

3\. **Stage 2**: XR features – sclerosis, cysts (pre-collapse)

4\. **Stage 3**: Crescent sign – subchondral collapse

5\. **Stage 4**: Femoral head deformation & flattening

6\. **Stage 5**: Joint space narrowing

7\. **Stage 6**: Advanced degenerative disease

**Comparison of Ficat and Steinberg:** - Essentially the same, focusing on **Stage 3 (crescent sign)** as the critical stage. - Steinberg quantifies the degree of collapse and arthrosis better in stages 4, 5, and 6.

### Quantification of Head Necrosis

-   **Multiply the % involvement on AP view by % involved on lateral view**
-   **50% on both views equates to 25% total volume involved**
-   (0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25) (25%)

### Important Factors in Management Decisions:

```         
- **Size of necrotic lesion**
- **Presence of the crescent sign**
- **Degree of head collapse**
- **Acetabular changes**
```

## Diagnosis

**Clinical Presentation:** - **Groin pain, risk factors, limp, insidious chronic onset**

**Imaging:**

\- **XR**:

-   Sclerosis & cysts

-   Crescent sign

-   Joint space narrowing

-   Severe arthrosis

\- **MRI**:

-   99% sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis

-   **Pathognomonic sign: Double line sign (present in 80%)**

-   **MR appearances correspond to stage of AVN**:

-   **Fat \> Blood \> Fluid \> fibrous tissue = Early \> Late disease**

-   **High T1, Intermediate T2**

-   **High T1, High T2**

-   **Low T1, High T2**

-   **Low T1, Low T2**

## Management

### Non-Surgical:

-   **NWB (Non-Weight Bearing), USS (Ultrasound), and ECSW (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy)**:
    -   Not proven to help but useful to try if unfit for surgery
-   **Bisphosphonates**:
    -   May be helpful in slowing down the rate of head collapse but not currently recommended as first-line treatment

### Surgical:

-   **The treatment of choice** as it is proven to alter natural history
-   **Bone conserving versus Arthroplasty**:
    -   **Presence of the crescent sign** indicates arthroplasty (unless very small)
-   **Core Decompression**:
    -   **Ficat 1 or 2**
    -   Small to medium necrotic lesion (30% max)
    -   **Reduction of pressure relieves venous congestion**
    -   Encourages neovascularisation
    -   Cannulated drill or DHS reamer without the proximal large flute
    -   Drill into the lesion but avoid joint penetration
    -   Pre-op MRI to outline the area to aim for
    -   Send reamings for histology
    -   Some surgeons then insert non-vascularised bone graft up the channel ± BMP to encourage healing
    -   **Not shown to be better than decompression alone**
    -   **Results**:
        -   70% good at up to 8 years
        -   Smaller the lesion, the better the results
        -   Not as good for steroid-induced AVN
-   **Osteotomy**:
    -   **Ficat 1-3**
    -   Small localised lesions \<50%
    -   Valgus, varus, or rotational osteotomy depending on location
    -   Will not work in collapse \>50%
    -   Rarely done in the UK due to issues with:
        -   Non-union of osteotomy
        -   Technical difficulty
        -   Makes THR salvage more difficult
    -   **Results**:
        -   Good reported in Japan and Korea
        -   Not reproduced in the West
-   **Vascularised Bone Graft**:
    -   **Ficat 1-3**
    -   Lesions \<50% in size
    -   Harvest mid-portion fibula
    -   Drill and debride the necrotic lesion
    -   Introducing the fibula into the drill track
    -   A microvascular anastomosis is then performed between the peroneal vessels and the ascending lateral circumflex artery
    -   **Results**:
        -   Up to 90% success at 5 years in type 1-3 lesions
        -   Useful for larger size lesions without significant collapse
        -   Best results still in stage 1 or 2 pre-collapse
    -   Time-consuming technique requiring a highly skilled team
-   **Arthroplasty**:
    -   **Ficat 3 or 4**
    -   If stage 3 lesion should be of significant size
    -   Older Patients – single operation
    -   **Results of THR**:
        -   As good for AVN as in OA (Osteoarthritis)
        -   Avoid if possible in young but still has good outcomes
    -   **Resurfacing contra-indicated**
-   **Arthrodesis**:
    -   An option for very young patients
    -   Position of fusion is:
        -   30 deg flexion
        -   0-5 deg external rotation
        -   0-5 deg adduction
    -   **Results**:
        -   Not as good as for fusion in OA (Osteoarthritis) – more non-union
        -   5% have back pain
        -   40% have ipsilateral knee pain
        -   20% have contralateral hip pain
