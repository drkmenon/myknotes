## Osteoarthritis

::: callout-note
## Definition

Mechanically driven but biologically mediated complex degenerative process starting at the tangential zone of articular cartilage of a synovial joint.
:::

### Aetiology

-   **Primary**:
    -   Idiopathic
    -   Genetic element
    -   Mechanical factors
-   **Secondary**:
    -   Post-traumatic
    -   Post DDH, SUFE, or Perthes
    -   AVN
    -   Inflammatory arthritis (RA, Ankylosing Spondylitis)

### Pathology

#### Primary Events:

-   Altered proteoglycan function
-   Reduced subchondral venous drainage
-   Altered cartilage permeability

#### Results:

-   Influx of water
-   Reduced stiffness
-   Altered viscoelastic properties
-   Loss of chondrocyte ability to maintain cartilage
-   Fibrillation (fissuring)
-   Loss of hyaline cartilage
-   Subchondral exposure and hypertrophy (sclerosis)
-   Cyst formation
-   Compensatory osteophyte formation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

### Epidemiology

-   More common in Caucasians
-   Females: 2:1 compared to males
-   Typically onset around 40 years
-   1-5% of the population depending on ethnicity

### Aetiology

-   Seropositive, autoimmune inflammatory polyarthritis.
-   Characterized by synovitis, periarticular erosions, joint destruction, and systemic manifestations.
-   Rh factor positive in 80%.
-   Primarily affects synovium, leading to secondary joint destruction.

### Pathophysiology

-   Inflammatory infiltration of synovium with B cells, T cells, and macrophages.
-   Joint destruction is mechanical (due to inflamed synovium) and chemical (due to inflammatory factors).
-   Positive for **HLA DR**.

#### Rheumatoid Factor (RF)

-   Autoantibody that targets the Fc part of IgG.
-   Correlates with the severity of the disease and joint destruction.
-   RF may be raised in other systemic conditions, but has poor positive predictive value.

### Clinical Features

-   **Inflammation** of joints.
-   **Symmetric polyarthropathy**.
-   Morning pain and stiffness (eases with activity).
-   **Extra-articular features**:
    -   Rheumatoid nodules (30% of patients):
        -   Found on extensor aspect of arms.
        -   Pathognomonic: Fibrotic capsule surrounding fibrous necrotic center.
        -   Non-inflammatory; contains cholesterol crystals on aspiration.
    -   Uveitis
    -   Cardiac problems
    -   Neurologic problems

### Imaging Features

-   Periarticular osteopenia.
-   Juxtaarticular erosions.
-   Significant deformity and subluxation due to soft tissue involvement.

### Diagnostic Criteria (American College of Rheumatologists)

-   Need to have 4 out of 7 criteria and 3 of the top 4 for at least 6 weeks:
    1.  **S** Symmetric arthritis
    2.  **H** Hand or wrist arthritis for \>6 weeks
    3.  **A** Arthritis in at least 3 joints for \>6 weeks
    4.  **M** Morning stiffness for 1 hour a day for \>6 weeks
    5.  **P** Positive rheumatoid factor
    6.  **E** X-ray changes
    7.  **R** Rheumatoid nodules

### Management

-   **NSAIDs**, prednisolone for acute flare-ups.
-   **Disease-modifying agents (DMARDs)**:
    -   Methotrexate
    -   Sulfasalazine
    -   Hydroxychloroquine (antimalarial)
-   **Biologic Response Modulators (BRMs)**:
    -   Etanercept
    -   Infliximab
    -   Rituximab
-   **Surgery**:
    -   Synovectomy: Good pain relief, especially in knee.
    -   Does not alter long-term joint destruction.
    -   **Arthroplasty**: Higher infection rate, poor bone quality, beware of joint instability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy

These are RF-negative arthritidies: 1. **Ankylosing Spondylitis** (see spine notes) 2. **Psoriatic Arthritis** 3. **Enteropathic Arthritis** 4. **Reactive Arthritis** (Reiter’s syndrome) 5. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Psoriatic Arthritis

### Aetiology

-   Occurs in 20% of patients with psoriasis.
-   80% have preceding skin manifestations of psoriasis.
-   50% are HLA B27 positive.

### Clinical Features

-   May cause psoriatic spondylitis (uncommon).
-   Predominantly affects hands, especially **DIPJ**.
-   **Dactylitis** (sausage digits).
-   **Pencil-in-cup** deformity of DIPJ.
-   **Nail pitting**.
-   Distinguished from RA by:
    -   **RF usually negative**.
    -   **Asymmetric**.
    -   Absence of rheumatoid nodules.

### Management

-   Medical: NSAIDs, DMARDs.
-   Surgical: Joint fusions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Enteropathic Arthritis

-   Occurs in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn’s disease.
-   Affects lower limbs, but also spine.
-   Spondylitis similar to ankylosing spondylitis.
-   Severity of arthritis correlates with severity of gut inflammation.
-   **Extra-articular features** include uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, etc.

### Management

-   Mainly medical: Manage gut inflammation (e.g., sulfasalazine), which helps arthritis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis)

### Epidemiology

-   Affects individuals under 16 years of age.

### Aetiology

-   Similar to rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory polyarticular disease with systemic manifestations.

### Clinical Features

-   **Classic difference** in hand from RA:
    -   **Wrist** is ulnar deviated.

    2.  **Oligoarticular (Paucarticular)**:
        -   Most common type.
        -   Affects \<5 joints.
        -   More in girls.
