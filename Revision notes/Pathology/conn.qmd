## Marfan’s Syndrome

### Epidemiology

-   1 in 10,000 live births
-   No gender predilection

### Aetiology

-   Autosomal Dominant
-   25% new mutations
-   Problem with Fibrillin gene on chromosome 15q21

### Clinical Signs

-   Tall, spindly hands, joint hypermobility
-   **Wrist Sign** (Walker’s test): Index and thumb overlap when encircling opposite wrist
-   **Thumb Sign** (Steinberg test): If thumb adducted across palm, it comes out of closed fist
-   **Arm span: height ratio** \> 1.05

### Diagnostic Criteria (GHENT system)

-   One major criterion in two different organ systems & involvement of a third

### Main Affected Body Areas

1.  **Orthopaedic**
    -   Joint hypermobility
    -   Scoliosis
    -   Dural ectasia
    -   Protrusio acetabuli
    -   Planovalgus feet
2.  **Cardiothoracic**
    -   Pectus Excavatum
    -   Spontaneous Pneumothorax
    -   Aortic Dissection
    -   Aortic root dilatation
    -   Mitral valve prolapse
3.  **Eyes**
    -   Superior lens dislocation
4.  **Abdomen**
    -   Stretch marks
    -   Recurrent hernias

### Management

-   Referral for ECHO if not done already
-   Genetic counselling
-   Aggressive treatment of scoliosis
    -   High incidence of curve progression
    -   Pseudoarthrosis may occur with fusion
    -   Complicated by dural ectasia
-   Surgical closure of triradiate cartilage to halt protrusio
-   Surgery for planovalgus feet

## Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

### Aetiology

-   Disorder causing:
    -   Hypermobility of joints
    -   Excessive skin laxity
-   All types have mutation of one of the **COL** genes
-   50% involve **COL5A1** or **COL5A2** (classic type: Type 5 collagen – skin collagen)
-   Vascular and Spinal Subtypes have slightly different mutations
-   Classic form is Autosomal Dominant

### Clinical Features

-   **Skin**:
    -   Fragile
    -   Lax
    -   Easily scarred
-   **Joint Hypermobility**:
    -   Recurrent dislocations, especially shoulder
-   Severe kyphoscoliosis (spinal subtype):
    -   Needs aggressive treatment and long fusion
    -   Pseudoarthrosis more common
-   **Cardiac**:
    -   Aortic root dilatation (get ECHO if not done)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Osteogenesis Imperfecta

### Aetiology

-   Mutation of **COL1A1** or **COL1A2** gene (Collagen 1)
-   Affects normal bone formation

### Clinical Features

-   Bone heals normally but is very brittle
-   Multiple recurrent fractures
    -   Olecranon apophyseal avulsion fracture is frequent
    -   Fractures slow down after maturity
-   Short stature
-   Normal intelligence
-   Scoliosis
-   Basilar invagination
-   Codfish vertebrae (multiple compression fractures)
-   Tooth defects (dentinogenesis imperfecta)
-   Hearing difficulty (deafness in 50% by age 40)
-   Ligamentous laxity
-   Increased risk of malignant hyperthermia

### Subtypes

| Type | Sclera | Inheritance | Often De Novo | Features |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Blue sclera | AD | Yes | Mildest form; hearing deficit in 50% |
| 2 | Blue sclera | AR | Yes | Lethal in perinatal period |
| 3 | White sclera | AR | Yes | Progressive deformities; most severe survivable form |
| 4 | White sclera | AD | Yes | Moderate severity; hearing normal |
| 5–8 | Variable | Variable | Yes | None have collagen 1 mutation; similar phenotypes to Osteogenesis Imperfecta |

### Management

#### Non-surgical

-   Genetic counselling
-   Bisphosphonates:
    -   Shown to reduce fractures but complications if used long term
-   Growth hormone
-   Bone marrow transplant

#### Surgical

-   Prophylactic or therapeutic fixation of fractures:
    -   Use IM nails where possible to protect whole bone
-   Treat scoliosis aggressively
