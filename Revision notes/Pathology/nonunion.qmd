### Non-Union

#### Definition

-   No clinical or radiographic evidence of healing for 3 months beyond the expected healing time of a given bone, with no signs that the bone will continue towards union.

#### Risk Factors

| **Category** | **Risk Factors** |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Patient** | Smoking, alcoholism, radiotherapy, non-compliance, malnutrition, older age |
| **Fracture** | High energy fractures, bone loss, pathological fractures, compound fractures, specific bone involvement, avascular necrosis (AVN) |
| **Fixation** | Distracted fractures, periosteal stripping, inadequate stability |

#### Classification

| **Type** | **Description** |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Hypertrophic** | Adequate biology but inadequate mechanics. X-ray shows callus but incomplete bridging. |
| **Atrophic** | Inadequate biology. X-ray shows no callus and faded bone ends. Often caused by excessively rigid stabilization with inadequate fracture compression. |
| **Synovial** | A synovial joint (pseudoarthrosis) forms around the fracture. X-ray shows sclerotic bone ends, no callus formation. |
| **Infected** | May present with any radiographic appearance and may or may not show clinical signs of infection. |

#### Diagnosis

-   High index of suspicion based on risk factors for a given patient.

#### Clinical Union Indicators

-   Pain-free under physiological loading.
-   Non-mobile fracture.

#### X-ray Indicators of Non-Union

-   Persistent fracture gap.
-   Sclerotic, rounded, or faded bone ends.
-   Metalware failure or loosening.
-   New deformity.

#### X-ray Indicators of Union

-   Bridging callus and restoration of cortical congruity.
-   Obliteration of fracture gaps.
-   Bridging trabeculae on 3 out of 4 cortices.
-   The most reliable method is the number of cortices bridged.

#### Additional Diagnostic Tools

-   **CT Scan**: Useful for complex periarticular non-unions.
-   **Bone Scan**: Generally not very useful; may show cold areas in atrophic or synovial non-unions.
-   **MRI**: Good for diagnosing and quantifying infection and for pre-operative planning.

### Treatment of Non-Union

-   The treatment depends on the type of non-union.

#### Hypertrophic Non-Union

-   Improve the strain environment by lowering strain through interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation.

#### Infected Non-Union

-   The infection must be eradicated before healing can proceed.
-   Debride the non-union site back to clean, bleeding bone ends.
-   A staged protocol may be required.
-   Use external fixation if possible or techniques such as distraction osteogenesis.

#### Atrophic Non-Union

-   Problem due to biology or inadequate compression with rigid, low-strain fixation.
-   Debride the non-union site.
-   Drill the canals until bone bleeds.
-   Use bone grafting.
-   Fix rigidly with compression or use techniques such as exchange nailing with grafting.
-   The key is to create bleeding surfaces at the non-union site and use bone grafts to promote healing.
