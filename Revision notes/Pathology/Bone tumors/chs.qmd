## Subtypes

-   Classic Intramedullary
-   De-differentiated Chondrosarcoma
-   Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma
-   Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intramedullary Chondrosarcoma

### Epidemiology

-   Affects older patients (\>45 years)
-   Slightly more common in males

### Aetiology

-   Unknown
-   Associated with:
    -   Expression of telomerase and RT gene
    -   Presence of metastases
-   Rarely arises from solitary enchondroma (1%)
-   Increased risk in:
    -   Ollier’s disease (20%)
    -   Maffucci’s disease (100%)

### Presentation

-   Slow-growing painful mass
-   Bowel and bladder symptoms if pelvic involvement

### Clinical Features

-   Prognosis depends on grade:
    -   Most are low-grade
    -   High-grade tumors, especially de-differentiated, are aggressive

### Location

-   Common sites:
    -   Shoulder
    -   Pelvis
    -   Proximal femur
    -   Hand

### Imaging Features

-   Features vary by grade but typically include:
    -   Cortical erosion and breach
    -   Cortical thickening
    -   Chondroid spiculing and matrix
    -   Soft tissue mass
    -   Periosteal reaction
-   **Bone Scan**: High uptake in all grades and subtypes
-   **MRI and CT**: Critical for assessing soft tissue extent and surgical planning

### Pathology

-   Diagnosis may be challenging; histology is often featureless.
-   Hallmark: Invasion of trabecular bone
-   Other features:
    -   Large pleomorphic cells
    -   Binuclear nuclei
    -   Plump and large nuclei

### Management

-   Not radiosensitive or chemosensitive
-   **Low-grade tumors**: Treated with intralesional curettage and grafting
-   **High-grade tumors**:
    -   Wide or radical surgical resection
    -   Amputation for pelvic lesions if necessary
    -   Lung metastases resectable if feasible

### Outcomes

-   Prognosis depends on grade:
    -   **Grade 1**: 90%
    -   **Grade 2**: 60%
    -   **Grade 3**: 30%
    -   **De-differentiated**: 10%
-   Low-grade tumors may progress slowly over 20+ years.

## De-differentiated Chondrosarcoma

-   Same locations as intramedullary chondrosarcoma
-   Highly malignant
-   Comprises low-grade chondrosarcoma overlaid on a spindle cell tumor (e.g., osteosarcoma)
-   Features:
    -   Bimorphic radiologic and histologic appearance
-   Treatment:
    -   Wide or radical resection for chondroid component
    -   Chemotherapy for sarcoma component

## Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma

-   Rare
-   Radiologic Features:
    -   Lytic, well-demarcated lesion in the epiphysis of long bones
    -   Differential diagnosis: Chondroblastoma
-   Characteristics:
    -   Low or intermediate grade
-   Treatment:
    -   Same as other chondrosarcomas
-   Prognosis:
    -   80% long-term survival

## Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma

-   Very rare
-   Occurs in flat bones; lesions are lytic
-   Affects younger patients rather than older adults
-   Prognosis:
    -   50% survival at 5 years
