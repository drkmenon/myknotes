## Enneking System – Staging System

-   **Benign or malignant**
-   Enneking system is a post-resection staging system, but:
    -   Good approximation possible with a reliable biopsy and imaging
-   For malignant tumours, components are:
    -   **Grade**: High or low
    -   **Anatomic Features**: Intra or extra-compartmental
    -   **Metastases**: Present or not

### Grade (G1, G2 – low or high grade)

-   Grade determined by:
    -   Degree of normal cell differentiation
    -   Mitotic figures
    -   Pleomorphism (variation in cell size and shape)

#### Features of High-Grade Tumours:

-   High mitotic rate
-   Poorly differentiated (correlates with metastases)
-   Pleomorphism
-   Necrotic dark nuclei
-   High cell-matrix ratio
-   High risk of metastasis

### Anatomic Features – Intra or Extra-compartmental

-   **Intra-compartmental**: Within the bone or fascial compartment
-   **Extra-compartmental**: Breached the bone or fascial compartment
-   T1 MRI is best for detecting intramedullary extent and skip lesions

### Metastases

-   Presence or absence
-   Metastases automatically classify the tumour as Grade 3

### Staging Table

| Stage | Grade (G) | Anatomy (T) | Mets (M) | Classification |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Ia    | Low (G1)  | IC (T0)     | M0       | G1, T0, M0     |
| Ib    | Low (G1)  | EC (T1)     | M0       | G1, T1, M0     |
| IIa   | High (G2) | IC (T0)     | M0       | G2, T0, M0     |
| IIb   | High (G2) | EC (T1)     | M0       | G2, T1, M0     |
| IIIa  | Any       | IC (T0)     | M1       | G1/2, T0, M1   |
| IIIb  | Any       | EC (T1)     | M1       | G1/2, T1, M1   |

-   Stages I are all low grade
-   Stage II are all high grade
-   Stages III all have metastases

## Enneking Classification of Benign Bone Tumours

| Stage | Activity   | Examples                          |
|-------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1     | Latent     | Osteoid Osteoma, Enchondroma, NOF |
| 2     | Active     | Chondroblastoma, UBC              |
| 3     | Aggressive | GCT, ABC                          |

## Principles of Tumour Biopsy

### Biopsy Types

-   **Incisional Biopsy**
    -   Open incision and removal of tissue samples
-   **Excisional Biopsy**
    -   Only for lesions where diagnosis is almost certain and with low chance of recurrence (e.g., lipoma)
    -   Danger of recurrence with incomplete margins
-   **Percutaneous Biopsy**
    -   Fine needle aspiration for cytology (not as frequent in the UK as True Cut)
    -   True Cut biopsy for core specimen:
        -   More effective under CT or US guidance
        -   Yields 97% accuracy with expert technique
        -   Less detail about mitotic figures than incisional biopsy
        -   Does not usually affect management

### Principles of Performing an Incisional Biopsy

#### Planning

-   Performed by or in accordance with the surgeon doing the definitive procedure
-   Pathologist:
    -   Should be consulted regarding the ideal biopsy location
    -   Should be aware and ready to receive the biopsy
    -   Should be skilled to perform all tests on the specimen

#### Surgical Technique

-   Leave an excisable scar and biopsy tract (avoid transverse incisions)
-   Approach should not violate further muscle compartments
-   Meticulous haemostasis:
    -   Use a tourniquet and release before closure
    -   Drain out through the wound
-   Approach through muscle preferred for tight closure

#### Sampling Specimen

-   Take from soft rather than bony part
-   Prefer peripheral over necrotic centre (plan this beforehand)
-   Use frozen section to ensure sample is representative
-   Send for MC&S and histology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles of Work-Up

### History

-   Atypical pain; night pain; pain not relieved by analgesia
-   Neurological or vascular symptoms distally

### Examination

-   Examine NV structures
-   Conduct normal examination of the mass
-   Look for lymph nodes proximally
-   Examine breasts, thyroid, chest, prostate, and kidneys if metastases are suspected

### Laboratory Tests

-   Depends on the differential diagnosis:
    -   FBC, U&E, LFT, Clotting, CRP (mandatory)
    -   LDH & Alk Phos (prognostic criteria in Osteosarcoma)
    -   Myeloma screen in older patients; peripheral blood smear in younger patients
    -   Urine analysis

### Imaging

-   X-ray (bone and chest)
-   Skeletal survey for myeloma (often negative on bone scans)
-   Bone scan
-   MRI
-   Staging CT (chest, abdomen, pelvis)

### Important Descriptors of a Lesion

-   Patient age
-   Location in bone
-   Monostotic or polyostotic
-   Matrix:
    -   Permeative
    -   Sclerotic
    -   Ground-glass
-   Zone of transition:
    -   Narrow (geographic)
    -   Wide (indistinct)
-   Periosteal reaction
-   Soft tissue extent
-   Effect on bone and bone's effect on the lesion:
    -   Scalloped
    -   Walled off
    -   Expanded

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles of Management

-   All management should be coordinated by a bone tumour unit

### Limb Salvage Versus Amputation

-   Most limbs are salvageable with modern techniques and adjuvant therapy
-   Do not compromise limb function or tumour eradication to salvage a limb
-   Indications for amputation:
    -   Neurovascular infiltration rendering tumour irresectable without significant limb damage
    -   Extensive muscle invasion where resection compromises function
    -   Pathologic fracture with wide dissemination of tumour

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Levels of Resection

| Level | Description |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intralesional** | Through the tumour itself; 100% local recurrence; option for palliation of mass effect |
| **Marginal** | Through the pseudo-capsule (reactive zone); 50% local recurrence rate |
| **Wide (en bloc)** | Intracompartmental resection with a cuff of normal tissue attached; \<10% local recurrence |
| **Radical** | Extracompartmental resection; entire compartment and all tissues resected |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adjuvant & Neo-Adjuvant Therapy

### Chemotherapy

-   Causes programmed cell death (apoptosis):
    -   Direct DNA damage (e.g., alkylating agents)
    -   Deplete cellular building blocks (e.g., 5-fluoropyrimidines)
    -   Interfere with microtubule function (e.g., vinca alkaloids)
-   **Cochrane Review 2000**:
    -   Good for bony malignancy (e.g., Osteosarcoma, Ewing’s)
    -   Minimal benefit for soft tissue malignancy unless highly chemosensitive (e.g., Rhabdomyosarcoma)
-   Usual treatment protocol:
    -   Neo-adjuvant therapy pre-operatively
    -   Tumour re-staged, and surgery planned
    -   Adjuvant chemotherapy post-operatively

### Radiotherapy

-   Direct DNA damage by free radicals
-   **Indications**:
    -   Radiosensitive tumours (e.g., Ewing’s, lymphoma, breast cancer)
    -   Incomplete margins in difficult locations (e.g., spine, pelvis)
    -   Metastatic pain
-   **Complications**:
    -   Post-irradiation sarcoma
    -   Stress fracture
    -   Wound problems
    -   Fibrosis
    -   Lymphedema

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reconstructive Options

### Endoprosthesis

-   Mainstay treatment; usually includes a joint
-   Growing prostheses in children (magnet-based)
-   **Complications**:
    -   Extensive surgery
    -   Loosening and wear
-   **Survival**:
    -   70% at 5 years
    -   With revision, up to 90% at 10 years

### Autograft

-   Most commonly fibula; can hypertrophy with weight-bearing
-   Common in distal radius
-   Used as a strut graft to augment other reconstruction methods

### Allograft

-   Massive allografts used but are dead bone
-   Slow or no incorporation
-   Infection risk and limited availability
