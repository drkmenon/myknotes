## Classic Osteosarcoma (Intramedullary)

### Epidemiology

-   Male-to-female ratio: 1.5:1
-   Common in young adults and children

### Aetiology

-   Exact cause unknown
-   Associated with retinoblastoma gene and p53 translocation

### Location

-   Intramedullary meta-diaphyseal junction origin is classic
-   Most common around the knee
-   Less common in proximal humerus, proximal femur, and pelvis

### Presentation

-   Short history of pain
-   Mass
-   Symptoms may appear after an acute injury
-   Pathologic fracture in 10% of cases
-   20% of patients have lung metastases at presentation

### Imaging

#### XR

-   Simultaneous bone formation and lysis
-   Codman's triangle (elevated periosteum)
-   Sunray spicules (tumor invasion into bone remodeling)
-   Lesions may be sclerotic, lytic, or mixed
-   CXR: Evaluate for pulmonary metastases \#### MRI
-   Neurovascular involvement, surgical planning, and skip lesion assessment \#### Bone Scan
-   Screens for bony metastases and skip lesions \#### CT
-   Used for staging the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

### Histology

-   Intramedullary osteosarcoma is high grade
-   All osteosarcomas originate from spindle cells
-   Diagnosis requires the presence of malignant osteoid
-   Features include:
    -   Pleomorphic cells (altered size and shape)
    -   Dark-stained nuclei
    -   Poorly differentiated nuclei
    -   High mitotic activity
    -   Invasion into surrounding tissues

### Management

-   **Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy**: Administered for 6â€“12 weeks to induce tumor necrosis and stabilize the reactive zone
-   **Re-staging of tumor**
-   **Surgical excision**: Wide or radical excision based on stage and tumor necrosis
-   **Adjuvant chemotherapy**
-   **Amputation**: Only if the limb is unsalvageable
-   **Limb salvage**: Achievable in 90% of cases today
-   **Lung metastases**: Isolated cases are potentially resectable

### Outcomes

#### Poor Prognostic Indicators

1.  High LDH levels
2.  High alkaline phosphatase levels
3.  No DNA alteration post-chemotherapy
4.  Vascular invasion
5.  Metastases at presentation (bone worse than lung)
6.  Local recurrence or incomplete margins
7.  Expression of P-glycoprotein
8.  Absence of anti-shock protein 90 antibodies post-chemotherapy
9.  Presentation with pathologic fractures (higher recurrence rates)
10. Pelvic location

#### Good Prognostic Indicators

1.  No metastases and intracompartmental at presentation
2.  90% tumor necrosis after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy

#### Outcome Statistics

-   Overall 5-year survival: 70%
-   Pelvic osteosarcoma 5-year survival: 25%
-   Metastatic presentation 5-year survival: 20%
-   Local recurrence and bone metastases indicate poor long-term survival

## Intramedullary, Paraosteal, and Periosteal Osteosarcoma

### Osteosarcoma Subtypes

| Subtype | Grade | Location | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Paraosteal** | Low | Distal femur (75%) | Surface of bone, lobulated dense lesion like osteochondroma <br/> 95% survival with wide resection |
| **Periosteal** | Intermediate | Tibia or femur diaphysis | Extensive sunray spiculing, chondroid-like appearance, produces cartilage and osteoid |
| **Telangiectatic** | High | Intramedullary | Lytic lesion with blood-filled spaces, resembles aneurysmal bone cyst |
| **Paget's Osteosarcoma** | High | Femur, pelvis, craniofacial | Poor prognosis, often polyostotic, occurs in elderly patients |
| **Post-Radiation OS** | High | Prior radiotherapy site | Mean delay of 17 years, very aggressive |
