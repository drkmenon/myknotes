## Overview

### Common Lesions:

-   **Fibrous Dysplasia**
-   **Osteofibrous Dysplasia**
-   **Paget’s Disease of Bone**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fibrous Dysplasia

### Epidemiology

-   Females \> males (only other tumour with this ratio is GCT).
-   75% occur in individuals under 30 years old.

### Aetiology

-   Unknown cause.
-   **GS alpha protein mutation**: Overproduction of cAMP.
-   High expression of **FGF-23**.
-   Failure of bone to fully mineralize and mature into lamellar bone.
-   Immature woven bone with chondroid elements.
-   Non-hereditary.

### Clinical Features

-   Usually an incidental finding.
-   May present with pain or pathologic fracture.
-   **Monostotic** (80%) or **Polyostotic** (20%).
-   Polyostotic often associated with endocrinopathy:
    -   **McCune-Albright Syndrome**: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty, and pigmented skin lesions.
-   Rare malignant transformation (1%) to osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, or MFH.

### Location

-   Common: Proximal femur, ribs, maxilla, tibia, pelvis, spine.

### Pathology

-   No neoplastic cells.
-   **Alphabet soup/Chinese letter** appearance of immature woven bone.
-   Secondary ABC may occur.

### Differential Diagnosis

-   Low-grade osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma.

### Imaging Features

-   **Ground-glass matrix** with well-demarcated lytic lesion.
-   No periosteal reaction or cortical breech.
-   Long bone deformities (e.g., **shepherd's crook deformity** in femur).
-   **Bone scan**: High uptake.

### Management

-   Asymptomatic: Non-operative.
-   Pain relief: Bisphosphonates.
-   Surgical: Fix impending fractures; intralesional curettage and cortical allografts.
-   Avoid cancellous autograft due to replacement by dysplastic bone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Osteofibrous Dysplasia

### Epidemiology

-   More common in males.
-   Occurs in children.

### Aetiology

-   Unknown.
-   Associated with **Trisomy 7, 8, 12, 22**.
-   May be a precursor to adamantinoma.

### Clinical Features

-   Predilection for the anterior tibia.
-   Causes anterior or anterolateral tibial bowing.
-   May result in pseudarthrosis of the tibia.

### Pathology

-   Fibrous tissue with immature woven bone (similar to fibrous dysplasia).

### Imaging Features

-   **Diaphyseal eccentric, well-demarcated lytic lesions** within the cortex.

### Management

-   Non-operative if possible (may regress with physeal closure).
-   Surgical: Intralesional curettage and cortical allograft for bowing or pseudarthrosis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Paget’s Disease of Bone

### Definition

-   Metabolic bone disease with overactive osteoclasts and osteoblasts, leading to disorganized bone formation.

### Epidemiology

-   Slight male predominance.

-   Geographic predilection (e.g., USA, UK).

-   

    ## Prevalence increases with age:

    ```         
    > 40 years: 3%.
    ```

    -   

        > 80 years: 10%.

### Types

-   **Monostotic**: 20%.
-   **Polyostotic**: 80%.

### Cause

-   Viral (e.g., paramyxovirus).
-   Genetic predisposition.

### Pathophysiology

1.  **Osteoclastic overactivity**: Increased size and number of osteoclasts.
2.  **Compensatory osteoblast activity**: Disorganized, accelerated bone formation.

### Phases

1.  **Lytic**: Osteoclastic dominance.
2.  **Active**: Mixed osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity.
3.  **Burnt out**: Residual effects with coarse trabeculae.

### Clinical Features

-   Asymptomatic in 95% (incidental finding).
-   **Bone pain** (rare but indicates high turnover or malignancy).
-   Fractures, arthritis, deformity, nerve compression, cardiac failure, gout.
-   **Malignant transformation**: Osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma.

### Imaging Features

-   Widened bones, stress fractures.
-   **Blade/flame sign** in lytic phase.
-   Mixed sclerotic/lytic patterns (mosaic-like).
-   Deformities (e.g., **sabre tibia**).

### Laboratory Tests

-   Normal calcium.
-   Elevated alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase.
-   Increased markers of collagen turnover.

### Management

#### Medical

-   Bisphosphonates: Osteoclast inhibition.
-   Calcitonin (rarely used).

#### Surgical

-   Favor fracture fixation due to long healing times.
-   Arthroplasty, nerve decompression.
-   Treat malignant transformation.

### Malignant Transformation

-   **30x risk of osteosarcoma** in polystotic disease.
-   Fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma also possible.
