## Melorheostosis

### Epidemiology

-   Typically discovered around age 40.

### Aetiology

-   Excessive periosteal bone formation.
-   Unknown cause; non-hereditary.

### Clinical Features

-   Painful.
-   Skin changes: erythema, warmth, fibrosis, and induration.
-   Commonly affects the lower limb.

### Imaging Features

-   **"Dripping candle wax"** appearance: periosteal bone extending along the outer bone surface and crossing joints.

### Pathology

-   Normal bone features.

### Management

-   Symptomatic treatment.
-   Surgical excision for prominent areas.
-   Release joint contractures.

## Gorham Disease

### Overview

-   Also known as **Massive Spontaneous Osteolysis** or **Vanishing Bone Disease**.
-   No curative treatment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gaucher Disease

### Aetiology

-   **Enzyme deficiency**: Glucocerebrosidase.
-   Autosomal recessive disorder leading to:
    -   Pancytopenia.
    -   Thrombocytopenia.
    -   Osteonecrosis and fractures.

### Epidemiology

-   Most common in **Ashkenazi Jews**.

### Imaging Features

-   **Erlenmeyer flask deformity** of long bones.
-   Subchondral and vertebral collapse.
-   Lucent metaphyseal areas.

### Management

-   Enzyme replacement therapy.
-   Symptomatic management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Neuropathic Arthropathy (Charcot Joint)

### Definition

-   Joint destruction caused by trauma due to loss of protective sensation.

### Aetiology

-   Chronic sensory nerve issues:
    -   **Diabetes** (foot and ankle).
    -   **Alcoholism**.
    -   **Spinal cord anomalies** (malformation, tumor).
    -   **Syphilis** (knee).
    -   **Syringomyelia** (shoulder and elbow).

### Clinical Features

-   Early stages mimic osteoarthritis.
-   Late stages resemble infection.

### Imaging Features

-   Joint subluxations, collapse, and hypertrophic bone formation.

### Management

-   Treat reversible causes.
-   Fusion or reconstruction of joints.
-   **Total contact casting** for ulcers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Haemophilic Arthropathy

### Aetiology

-   **Haemophilia A**: Factor VIII deficiency.
-   **Haemophilia B**: Factor IX deficiency (Christmas disease).
-   X-linked recessive inheritance.
-   Repeated haemarthroses leading to hypertrophied synovium and cartilage erosion.

### Imaging Features

-   Squared distal pole of the patella.
-   Flattened distal femur.
-   Overgrowth of tibia and femur.

### Management

-   Prevent haemarthrosis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)

### Epidemiology

-   Middle-aged adults; men = women.

### Aetiology

-   Benign but locally aggressive synovial proliferation.
-   Often associated with prior trauma.

### Clinical Features

-   Pain, restricted ROM, and swelling.
-   **Diffuse or nodular** form:
    -   Nodular: Single nodule in the joint.
    -   Diffuse: Recurrent haemarthroses.

### Common Locations

-   Knee (80%) \> hip \> shoulder \> ankle.

### Diagnosis

-   **X-ray**: Bony erosions on both sides of the joint.
-   **MRI**: Dark nodule or nodular proliferation, sometimes with fat signals and haemarthrosis.

### Pathology

-   Inflamed synovium with haemosiderin deposition.

### Management

-   **Nodular**: Excision.
-   **Diffuse**: Total synovectomy (arthroscopic or open).
-   Arthroplasty for secondary arthrosis.
-   Recurrence rate: \~20% (usually due to incomplete excision).
