title: "Malignant Soft Tissue Tumours"
---

## General Points

-   All malignant soft tissue tumours are called sarcomas.
-   They are sub-classified by tissue of origin (e.g., liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma).
-   They tend to be \>5 cm in size at presentation but may be smaller.
-   Sarcomas have a centripetal growth pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Epidemiology

-   Tend to be in older patients (80% \>50 years).
-   Males \> Females.
-   They are fairly rare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Worrying Clinical Features

-   Fast growing.
-   Painful.
-   Large size (\>5 cm).
-   Neurologic, vascular symptoms.
-   Tethering to other structures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Imaging

-   MRI scan of most sarcomas is indeterminate, i.e., they do not look like a lipoma, ganglion, or other characteristic benign soft tissue lesion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Biopsy

-   Usually require an incisional or needle biopsy.
-   Never do an excisional biopsy without being sure of what the lesion is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adjuvant Therapy

-   Chemotherapy is not of use in soft tissue sarcomas (except Ewings & Rhabdo).
-   Radiation therapy is useful (external beam or brachytherapy).
-   No overall difference in pre- or post-operative radiotherapy.

### Pre-operative Radiotherapy

-   Leaves a thick fibrous capsule around the tumour, which is easier to excise.
-   Smaller dose required.
-   Less radiation-induced sarcoma; skin/joint contracture.
-   More wound complications and higher infection risk.
-   Wait 3 weeks after radiotherapy before operating.

### Post-operative Radiotherapy

-   Fewer wound problems once wounds have healed.
-   Higher dosage required = more other complications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Surgical Principles

-   Use a tourniquet without exsanguination.
-   Meticulous haemostasis.
-   Drain through or directly in line with the wound.
-   Excise the biopsy track.
-   Performed by or in conjunction with a tumour unit.
-   Safe margins generally need free flap reconstruction.
-   Wide excision is recommended.
-   Marginal excision would go through the reactive zone.
-   Decision to salvage or amputate is the same as for bone tumours – can a functional, disease-free limb be left?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Outcomes

-   Dependent on tumour grade.
-   50% with high-grade sarcoma die from the disease.
-   Poor prognostic factors:
    -   High grade.
    -   Metastases at presentation (lymph node, lungs).
    -   Depth of tumour.
    -   Size of tumour.
    -   Vascular compromise of the limb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Subtypes

1.  Synovial Sarcoma
2.  Clear Cell Sarcoma
3.  Epithelioid Sarcoma
4.  Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH)
5.  Liposarcoma
6.  Fibrosarcoma
7.  Rhabdomyosarcoma
8.  Leiomyosarcoma
9.  Neurofibrosarcoma (Malignant Nerve Sheath Tumour)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Synovial Sarcoma

**Epidemiology** - Most common soft tissue sarcoma in young adults (14–40 years).

**Aetiology** - Abnormality of SYT gene. - Translocation of X18 chromosome.

**Clinical Features** - Highly malignant, high-grade lesion. - Most common soft tissue sarcoma in the foot.

**Location** - Para-articular regions, especially the knee; rarely involves a joint.

**Imaging** - Low signal T1, high signal T2. - Calcifications within the lesion.

**Pathology** - High grade. - Biphasic histology – combination of fibrous (spindle cell) and epithelial cells.

**Management** - Consider chemotherapy as adjunct to surgery – young patients tolerate better.

## Clear Cell Sarcoma

### Epidemiology

-   Young adults (20–40 years)\
-   Females \> Males (one of the few MSK tumours)

### Aetiology

-   Translocation of chromosomes 12 and 22

### Clinical Features

-   Most common soft tissue sarcoma of the foot\
-   Associated with tendon sheaths and aponeuroses\
-   Highly malignant with poor prognosis if pulmonary metastases\
-   Produces melanin – malignant melanoma of soft parts

### Imaging

-   2–6 cm\
-   Low signal T1, high signal T2\
-   Indeterminate on MRI – needs biopsy

### Pathology

-   Intracellular melanin\
-   Nests of round cells with clear cytoplasm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Epithelioid Sarcoma

### Epidemiology

-   Young adults

### Aetiology

-   Unknown

### Clinical Features

-   Most common sarcoma in the hand\
-   Closely related to tendon sheaths\
-   Easily mistaken for something else and resected – high local recurrence\
-   Slow-growing and pain-free, therefore may seem benign

### Imaging

-   Calcifications\
-   MRI – low signal on T1, high signal on T2\
-   Indeterminate – needs biopsy

### Management/Outcomes

-   Wide excision and radiotherapy\
-   Often amputation needed\
-   Late metastases to lung are common\
-   Prognosis is poor

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH)

### Epidemiology

-   Most common sarcoma of older adults (\>55 years)

### Clinical Features

-   Slow-growing painless mass\
-   Can become very big\
-   May cause systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss

### Imaging

-   Low signal T1, high signal T2\
