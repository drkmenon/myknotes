## Aetiology
- Primary idiopathic – best prognosis
- Diabetic frozen shoulder – worse prognosis, protracted course
- Secondary – worse prognosis
- Neuromuscular – secondary to CVA, poor prognosis  
- Diabetes  
  - 75% with FS have diabetes or undiagnosed insulin resistance  
  - Diabetics have 10% lifetime risk of FS  
- Genetic  
  - Increased risk in twins, some genetic link  

---

## Epidemiology
- Women > men
- Unusual <40 years and >70 years
- Secondary FS can occur at any age
- Unusual in manual workers
- 85% unilateral
- 20% develop subsequent contralateral FS
- Recurrence in same shoulder uncommon
- 15% bilateral simultaneous  
  - Of these, 80% have recurrence within 5 years

## Pathoanatomy
1. First, the anterior superior capsule is affected  
   - Corresponds to rotator interval  
   - Capsule, CHL & SGHL involved  
   - Restricted ER in adduction  
2. Anterior inferior capsular contracture follows  
   - Capsule & IGHL involved  
   - Restricted ER in abduction  
3. Posterior capsule contracture in severe cases  
   - Restricted internal rotation  
4. Secondary FS  
   - Extra-articular structures may also be contracted  
   - Rotator cuff, especially subscapularis  
   - More global stiffness  

---

## Histology
- Inflammatory and fibrous tissue
- Akin to Dupuytren's when fibrotic
- Type 3 collagen, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts & angiogenesis predominate
- Type 3 collagen deposition causes stiffness  

---

## Natural History
- Resolution occurs over 18-24 months
- Three stages  
  1. Freezing – very painful  
  2. Frozen – pain subsides, stiffness predominates  
  3. Thawing – stiffness improves  
  (Significant overlap between stages)
- 40% have persistent symptoms or signs at 5 years
- Around 20% will have some functional deficit at 5 years

## Clinical Features
### History
- Insidious onset or secondary to other pathology
- Severe pain
- Night pain
- Burning
- Diffuse in nature
- CRPS-type character  

### Examination
- ROM assessment  
  - ER in adduction = rotator interval mainly  
  - ER in abduction = anterior-inferior capsule  
  - IR = posterior capsule  
  - Global restriction = severe primary FS or secondary FS  
- Cuff power usually intact  

---

## Imaging
### Plain X-ray
- Exclude causes of secondary FS (e.g., calcific tendonitis)
- Identify other causes of stiffness (e.g., dislocation, GHJ arthritis)

### Other
- MRI – if suspect cuff pathology
- Blood glucose levels – screen for diabetes  

---

## Management
### Goals
- Relieve pain
- Restore ROM
- Restore function  

### Analgesia & Activity Modification
- Useful in the acute painful period
- Physiotherapy painful initially  

### Physiotherapy
- Cochrane review – no significant benefit over doing nothing
- Likely beneficial in  
  - Limiting progression  
  - Aiding recovery once it starts  
  - Motivational & supervisory support  

### Steroids – Oral or Intra-Articular
- Cochrane review – no long-term difference
- Helpful for short-term pain & ROM but effects not sustained
- Can cause rebound stiffness
- Side effects limit use  

### Distension Arthrography
- Reasonable evidence for medium-term benefit in primary FS
- Less effective in secondary FS due to extra-articular contractures
- Technique  
  1. Arthrogram to confirm no cuff tear  
  2. Insufflate joint until pressure decreases (capsular rupture)  
  3. Steroid injection  
  4. Aggressive physiotherapy  

### Manipulation Under Anaesthetic (MUA)
- Good relief & ROM improvement
- Limited high-level studies
- More useful for anterior & anterior-inferior capsule tightness
- Technique  
  1. Interscalene block  
  2. Short lever arm  
  3. Order of Manipulation – FF, ER in ADD, ER in ABD, IR  
  4. Steroid injection  
  5. Physiotherapy  

### Arthroscopic Release
- Better pain relief & functional improvement than MUA alone
- Combine with MUA  
  - Perform MUA first – increases space for arthroscopy  
- Treats anterior capsular contracture
- Release technique  
  - Interscalene block for post-op pain relief  
  - Focus on releasing rotator interval structures  
    - CHL, SGHL, MGHL, capsule  
  - 360-degree release if persistent stiffness  
  - More release = higher nerve injury risk  
- Combine with ASAD if extra-articular contracture present  

### Open Release
- Rarely done
- For failed arthroscopic release
- If metalware needs removal or bony lesions need excision
- More painful

## Treatment Algorithm
1. Try physio, analgesia & activity modification first  
2. If no improvement & patient wants treatment → proceed to MUA  
3. Treat concurrent pathology if secondary FS  
4. If MUA unsatisfactory → proceed to arthroscopic release  
5. Use a steroid injection after any procedure & liberal use of IS blocks
