## Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

### Aetiology
- Vascular (subclavian artery) or neurologic compression
- Neurogenic less common  
  - Females > males  
  - <30 years old  
  - BP lower trunk most often  

### Sites of Compression (c, s, c, s, c, s, p)
1. Cervical rib  
2. Scalene muscle  
3. Clavicle malunion  
4. SCM  
5. Congenital fibrous bands  
6. Scapula ptosis  
7. Pancoast’s tumour  

### Clinical Features
- Paresthesias from shoulder to fingers  
- Affects C8/T1 distribution normally  
- Intrinsic wasting or weakness  
- Vascular symptoms  
- Symptoms positional or activity-related  
  - Overhead tasks  
  - Night symptoms  

### Diagnosis
#### Clinical
- NCS & EMG – useful to rule out peripheral lesions  
- **Adson’s Test**  
  - Extend neck, turn head towards affected side & take deep breaths  
- **Wright’s Test**  
  - Abduction, ER & extension of arm with head turned away  

#### CXR/CT/MRI
- Cervical rib  
- Tumour  
- Anomalous muscle  
- MR directly visualizes plexus  
- CT/MR arterial and venous studies  

### Management
#### Physio
- Relaxation techniques, posture control  

#### Operative
- If neurologic deficit  
- Identifiable cause  
- **Transaxillary 1st rib resection**  
  - 90% improvement but high complication rate

## Suprascapular Nerve Compression

### Causes
1. Spinoglenoid notch cyst  
2. Ganglion  
3. Entrapment under suprascapular notch ligament  
4. Fracture callus  
5. Late cocking phase – SS & IS tendon compresses nerve  

### Clinical Features
- Depend on where nerve is trapped  
  - Prior to spinoglenoid notch → SS & IS weakness & atrophy  
  - At spinoglenoid notch or after → only IS problem  
- Dull, non-specific ache over dorsum shoulder common to both  

### Investigations
- NCS & EMG – confirm where lesion is and which muscle affected  
- MRI – screen for associated SLAP tear, ganglion, or cyst  

### Management
- Repair SLAP and decompress cyst  
- Decompress nerve as necessary depending on offending structure

## Long Thoracic Nerve Palsy

- Results in weakness of serratus anterior  
- Causes medial scapular winging – trapezius still active  

### Causes
- Compression (e.g., backpackers)  
- Traction (e.g., weightlifters)  

### Management
- Observe as most improve spontaneously  
- May take as long as 18 months  
- Pectoralis major transfer for those that don’t

## Quadrilateral Space Syndrome

- Caused by compression of axillary nerve in quadrilateral space  
- Pain and paresthesia around shoulder – vague  
- Typical in throwing athletes  
  - ER, ABD, EXT causes compression of axillary nerve  
  - Late cocking phase  

### Diagnosis
- **EMG, NCS** – may be negative as symptoms are dynamic  
- **Arteriogram**  
  - Compression of posterior humeral circumflex in quadrilateral space  

### Management
- Decompression if no improvement with activity modification
