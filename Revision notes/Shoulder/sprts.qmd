## SLAP Tears  

### Aetiology  
- Overhead sports, especially throwing  
- Repetitive or chronic  
- Often in association with other conditions  

### Clinical Diagnosis  

#### History  
- Pain with overhead activity  
- Deep anterior pain  
- Clicking  

#### Clinical Tests  
- **Crank test**  
- **O’Brien’s test**  
  - More pain with arm internally rotated than externally rotated  
  - Replicates compression of humeral head against SLAP lesion  
  - False positive with ACJ arthritis  
  - High sensitivity, low specificity  

#### MRI Arthrogram  
- Usually diagnostic  

#### Diagnostic Arthroscopy  
- Gold standard  

### Outcomes  
- Good with appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and rehab  
- Fixation prone to causing stiffness; only perform if history, examination, and arthroscopic findings fit  
- Stiffness is especially problematic with concurrent cuff repair  

### Classification  

| Type  | Description | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Type 1 | Fraying of superior labrum, intact anchor | Debride |
| Type 2 | Unstable Biceps Anchor | Re-attach |
| Type 3 | Bucket handle detachment of superior labrum from intact biceps anchor | Debride |
| Type 4 | Bucket handle detachment of whole biceps anchor with propagation into LHB tendon | Re-attach +/- LHB tenotomy |

**Additional Types:**  
- **Type 5** – SLAP with Labral tear – reattach both  
- **Type 6** – Superior flap tear – debride  
- **Type 7** – SLAP with capsular tear – fix and reattach

## Spinoglenoid Notch Cyst  

### Aetiology  
- In association with a SLAP tear  
- Synovial fluid leaks out via SLAP to form a cyst in the spinoglenoid notch  
- Causes compression of suprascapular nerve at spinoglenoid notch  
- Suprascapular nerve has already given off branch to supraspinatus, **only infraspinatus is affected**  

### Clinical Features  
- Weakness out of proportion to pain  
- Infraspinatus fossa wasting  
- External rotation lag sign positive  

### Imaging  
- **MRI**  
  - High signal on T2  
  - SLAP lesion  

### Management  
- **Surgical if:**  
  - Nerve compression  
  - Symptomatic SLAP lesion  

- **Surgery:**  
  - Decompress cyst  
  - Repair SLAP (often repair alone suffices as cyst will resorb)  

### Complications  
- Recurrence – rare if SLAP repaired  
- Suprascapular nerve injury

## Internal Impingement  

### Aetiology  
- Posterior RTC is impinged against posterior superior aspect of glenoid  
- Due to:  
  1. Throwing sports – stretch anterior & tighten posterior capsule  
  2. Micro anterior instability  
  3. Posterior capsular tightness  

### Clinical Findings  
- Pain during the activity at the late cock back phase  
- Pain on abduction & external rotation of the arm  

### XR Features  
- May see extra-articular calcification behind posterior superior glenoid (**Bennett Lesion**)  

### MR Features  
- Articular surface RCT fraying  

### Arthroscopy  
1. Hypertrophy of posterior labrum  
2. Peel back of labrum  
3. Chondral damage  
4. Articular side cuff tear  

### Management  
- **Mainstay is non-operative**  
  - Sleeper stretches for posterior capsule  
  - RTC strengthening to minimize anterior stability  

- **Surgical – if non-operative fails**  
  - Debride and repair any structures at posterior-superior glenoid  
  - Address cuff tear:  
    - Debride if <50% thickness  
    - >50% perform transtendinous in situ repair without takedown

## Biceps Tendon Pathology  

### Tendinitis/Tendinosis  
- Almost never in isolation  
- Usually in association with RTC tear or bicipital groove stenosis  
  - Subscapularis  
  - Leading edge supraspinatus  
- Likely degenerative pathology  

### Diagnosis  
- Pain over anterior shoulder  
- Activity related  
- **Tests:**  
  - Speed’s  
  - Yergason’s  

- **MRI:**  
  - Fluid in bicipital groove  

### Management  

#### Non-Operative  
- Activity modification, analgesia, physiotherapy  
- Injection into LHB sheath  

#### Operative  
- Debridement of tendon and tendon sheath  
- Surgical decompression of stenotic sheath  
- **Tenodesis**  

---

## Proximal Biceps Rupture  
- Usually preceded by shoulder symptoms  
- Snap/pop  
- Extensive bruising  
- Popeye sign  
- Rarely needs any treatment at all  

---

## Biceps Tendon Subluxation  

### Aetiology  
- Strongly associated with subscapularis tear  
- May also be due to CHL tear or transverse humeral ligament tear  
- Subluxates into intra-articular space normally  
- May occur secondary to GT or LT fracture  

### Clinical Features  
- Popping sound & sensation on external rotation, abduction of arm  
- Patient points to area and can relocate tendon with rotation  
- Painful – tendon inflammation  
- Weakness of subscapularis  

### Imaging  
- **MRI or Dynamic USS**  
  - Demonstrate LHB outside its groove  
  - Subscapularis tear  
  - Fluid in sheath  

### Management  

#### Non-Operative  
- If possible  

#### Operative  
- Subscapularis repair  
- Relocation of tendon  
- Debridement of tendinotic portion and sheath  
- **Tenodesis**  
  - Detach from glenoid and fold back and sew to soft tissues or proximal humerus

## Acromioclavicular Joint Arthritis  

### Aetiology  
- Common in middle-aged and older people  
- Associated with:  
  - Heavy labor, pneumatic tools  
  - Post-traumatic ACJ injury  
  - Idiopathic  

### Clinical Features  
- Specific pain over ACJ  
- Impingement secondary to bone spurs  
- **Tests:**  
  - Cross arm abduction test  
  - Paxino’s compression test (AP compression of ACJ)  

### Diagnostic/Therapeutic LA/Steroid Injection  
- 2ml syringe & blue needle into ACJ following plane of joint from XR  

### Imaging  
- **XR**  
  - Often shows ACJ pathology (not always symptomatic, beware of other shoulder conditions)  
- **MRI**  
  - If doubt over diagnosis  
  - Screens rest of shoulder for other pathology  
  - Shows high signal in ACJ – more likely to be a pain source  

### Management  

#### Non-Operative  
- Activity modification, analgesia  
- Injection – diagnostic and therapeutic  

#### Surgical  
- **Arthroscopic:**  
  - Anterior working portal opposite ACJ  
  - Lateral viewing portal  
  - Excise bone on either side of joint (more from clavicle than acromion)  
  - Leave superior capsule intact – main stabilizer  
  - Ensure removal of all impinging bone posteriorly (main cause of procedure failure)  

- **Open:**  
  - Useful if angle of ACJ difficult to resect arthroscopically  
  - Results equal if not better than arthroscopic  
  - Slightly longer recovery  
  - Can be painful for several weeks  
  - Raise full-thickness capsular flaps to allow good repair  
  - Excise distal clavicle mainly  
  - Ensure posterior impinging bone all removed

## Distal Clavicle Osteolysis  

### Aetiology  
- Weight lifters  
- Overhead throwers  
- Post-traumatic distal clavicle fracture or ACJ injury  

### Clinical Presentation  
- Pain with overhead activities  
- Positive signs as for ACJ OA  

### Management  
- **Distal clavicle resection**  
- **Stabilize distal clavicle if elevated:**  
  - Weaver Dunn  
  - Surgilig fixation
