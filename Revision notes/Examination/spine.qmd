## **Move**

1.  **Roo’s Test (Neurologic):**
    -   Ask the patient to brace their shoulders back and fully flex elbows.
    -   Have them rapidly flex and extend fingers.
    -   Positive result if neurologic symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness) are reproduced.
2.  **Adson’s Test (Vascular):**
    -   Extend the head and rotate it to the affected side (similar to Spurlings test).
    -   Abduct the arm to 30 degrees with the elbow straight.
    -   Feel for the radial pulse on the same side.
    -   Take a deep breath in.
    -   Positive if there is an alteration in the quality of the pulse (e.g., disappearance or weakening of the pulse).

# Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Examination

## **History**

1.  **Key point in history:**
    -   Differentiate between vascular and neurogenic stenosis.
    -   Ask about walking distance and difficulty walking, onset and progression of symptoms.

## **Look**

1.  **Stooped posture:**
    -   Observe for a kyphotic or flexed posture, especially when standing.
2.  **Elderly:**
    -   Note the age of the patient.
3.  **Scars over the back:**
    -   Check for previous surgical scars which might indicate a history of back surgery.

## **Feel**

1.  **Pain over lower back:**
    -   Assess for localized or radicular pain in the lumbar area.

## **Move**

1.  **Restricted Range of Motion (ROM):**
    -   Look for limited forward bending, extension, and lateral bending.
2.  **Gait:**
    -   Observe for a stooped, shuffling gait with a slow cadence.
    -   The patient may walk with minimal movement to avoid symptoms.
3.  **Lie Down**
    -   Perform a full neurologic examination to assess for any abnormalities.
    -   Ask the patient to perform a bicycle test (exaggerated lumbar extension while sitting on a stationary bike). Pain relief in this position suggests neurogenic claudication.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Perform to assess for sacral root involvement.
2.  **Vascular examination:**
    -   Check pulses in the legs, for color changes, and for any signs of peripheral vascular disease.

# Lumbar Disc Herniation Examination

## **Look**

1.  **General screening:**
    -   Check for scars post-discectomy, which may indicate previous surgery.

## **Feel**

1.  **Pain in back:**
    -   Palpate the lumbar spine for tenderness and trigger points.

## **Move**

1.  **Range of Motion (ROM) examination:**
    -   Assess for restricted movements, especially in flexion, extension, and lateral bending.
2.  **Walk:**
    -   Observe gait for any limp, altered stride, or compensation (e.g., limp on the affected side).

## **Lie Down**

1.  **Full Neurologic Examination:**
    -   Perform a detailed sensory, motor, and reflex assessment.
2.  **Include sciatic stretch tests:**
    -   **SLR (Straight Leg Raise):**
        -   Positive if pain radiates down the leg below the knee.
    -   **Lesague’s test:**
        -   Extension of the knee with hip flexion increases radicular pain.
    -   **Cross over test:**
        -   Positive if pain radiates on crossing the unaffected leg over the affected one.
    -   **Bowstring test:**
        -   Relief of pain when the leg is lowered after a positive SLR.
    -   **Femoral Stretch test:**
        -   Pain in the anterior thigh when extending the knee from a flexed position at the hip.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Check for sacral root involvement and bowel function.
2.  **Vascular:**
    -   Assess pulses, color, and temperature in the legs.
3.  **MRI:**
    -   Recommended for visualization of the herniated disc and surrounding structures.

# Rheumatoid Cervical Spine Examination

## **Key Points**

-   Screen for myelopathy, impending myelopathy, and instability.
-   Focus on detecting signs that may indicate cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

## **History**

1.  **Neck pain:**
    -   Check for chronic or recent onset.
2.  **Occipital headaches:**
    -   Often related to RA-induced neck issues.
3.  **Change to walking:**
    -   New clumsiness, gait changes, or difficulty with balance.
4.  **Functional deterioration:**
    -   Difficulty with activities such as dressing or typing.
5.  **Urinary or bowel disturbance:**
    -   May indicate severe involvement affecting the cervical spine.
6.  **Past treatment:**
    -   Details on previous RA treatments, including medication and biologics.
7.  **Co-morbidities:**
    -   Other medical conditions affecting RA (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).

## **Examination**

### **Look**

1.  **General features of appearance related to rheumatoid:**
    -   Observe for any signs of severe RA (e.g., deformities in hands).
2.  **Hands:**
    -   Look for wasting, deformities, or changes that may be RA-specific (e.g., Swan neck deformity).

### **Feel**

1.  **Neck pain:**
    -   Palpate for tenderness, step deformity, or signs of atlantoaxial instability.
2.  **Sensation in upper limbs:**
    -   Check for any neuropathy related to RA (e.g., median nerve involvement).

### **Move**

1.  **Neck ROM (Range of Motion):**
    -   Reduced neck rotation, flexion, and extension can indicate cervical spine involvement.
2.  **Gait:**
    -   Observe gait for signs of a myelopathic gait (e.g., shuffling, broad-based, or ataxic gait).

### **Upper Limb Full Neurologic Exam**

1.  **Tone, power, reflexes:**
    -   Assess the upper limbs for any signs of weakness, clumsiness, or muscle wasting.
2.  **Myelopathy signs:**
    -   **Hofman's sign:** Rapid flicking of the index and thumb causes thumb adduction.
    -   **Scapula tap:** Tap on the scapula causes shoulder abduction and elbow flexion.
    -   **Inverted radial reflex:** An outward flicking motion of the thumb when lightly flicked.
    -   **Hyperreflexia:** May indicate spinal cord involvement.

### **Feel Lie Down**

1.  **Full Lower Limb Examination:**
    -   Sensory, motor, and reflex assessments.
    -   Check for signs of spasticity or clonus.

## **Finishing**

1.  **PR (Per Rectum) and perianal sensation:**
    -   Assess for sacral root involvement affecting bowel and bladder function.
2.  **Vascular Exam:**
    -   Look for signs of vascular insufficiency affecting the cervical spine.
3.  **X-rays:**
    -   AP (Antero-Posterior) and Lateral views to assess for joint destruction and stability.
4.  **MRI of Cervical Spine:**
    -   For detailed visualization of soft tissue changes, spinal cord compression, and instability.
