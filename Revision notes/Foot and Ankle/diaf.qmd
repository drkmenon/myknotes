## Two Main Problems  
1. Ulceration & Infection  
2. Charcot Arthropathy  

## Pathophysiology  
- Diabetes causes polyneuropathy, affecting sensory, autonomic, and motor nerves  
- Sensory neuropathy predominates  
  - Glove and stocking distribution, progressing from distal to proximal  
  - Hyperglycemia and micro-vessel disease alter axoplasmic blood flow  
  - Abnormal collagen cross-linking leads to stiffer tendons  
    - Contributes to Achilles contracture  
- Autonomic neuropathy reduces sympathetic activity  
  - Warm, pink, and dry skin due to altered sweating  
- Motor neuropathy is less dominant  
  - Primarily affects tibialis anterior and intrinsics  
  - Leads to equinus contracture and claw toes  
    - Deformity increases cutaneous foot pressures  

## Susceptibility to Infection  
- Main issue is decreased ability to combat infection  
- Infections are invariably contiguous through skin breaks, rarely haematogenous  

### Risk Factors for Skin Breaks  
- Dry skin susceptible to cracking  
- Areas of high pressure – MT heads & equinus contracture  
- Ulcers form due to impaired healing of fissures  
  - Neutrophil function impaired  
  - Microvascular blood flow decreased  
- Osteomyelitis results from contiguous deep spread of infection  
  - 67% (2/3) of ulcers probed to bone will have osteomyelitis  

## Pathophysiology of Charcot  
- Exact cause unknown, but related to neuropathy  
- Three theories:  
  - **Neurotraumatic theory**  
    - Loss of protective sensation and proprioception  
    - Repetitive microtrauma leads to uncontrolled deformity  
  - **Neurovascular theory**  
    - Autonomic neuropathy causes hyperaemia  
    - Hyperdynamic circulation alters bone resorption and synthesis balance  
  - **Inflammatory theory (favored)**  
    - Injury triggers an inflammatory cascade in susceptible patients  
    - Osteoclast activation leads to abnormal bone resorption and remodeling  
    - Loss of protective sensation allows deformity to progress  
- Most commonly seen in diabetics but also found in:  
  - Syphilis (historically, more common in knee)  
  - Alcoholic neuropathy  
  - CVA  
  - Spina bifida  
- Trauma is often the inciting event  
  - May be remembered or subclinical  
- Overactivity of osteoclasts and fracture healing cascade activation  
- Deformity and arthrosis progress unchecked due to loss of neurologic protection  
  - Predominantly affects midfoot but can occur anywhere  

## Classification  

### Wagner Classification of Diabetic Foot Ulcers  
- **Grade 0**: No ulcer but foot deformity at risk of ulceration  
- **Grade 1**: Superficial ulcer  
- **Grade 2**: Deep ulcer with visible bone or tendon  
- **Grade 3**: Deep ulcer with abscess or osteomyelitis  
- **Grade 4**: Ulcer with gangrene limited to the forefoot  
- **Grade 5**: Ulcer with gangrene of the whole foot  

**At each grade, management is influenced by:**  
- Vascularity of the foot  
- Presence of infection  

### Eichenholz Classification of Charcot Foot  
- **Stage 0 (Pre-fragmentation)**: Acutely inflamed, painful foot with regional bone demineralization  
- **Stage 1 (Fragmentation)**: Painful, peri-articular fragmentation and joint dislocation, demineralization  
- **Stage 2 (Coalescence)**: Less painful, sclerosis, and bone resorption  
- **Stage 3 (Remodeling)**: Pain-free, malunited, ankylosed joints  

## Clinical Evaluation  

### History  
- **Ulcer-related factors**: Pain, discharge, chronicity, treatments, previous ulcers  
- **Foot-related factors**: Pain, swelling, functional impairment  
- **Diabetes-related factors**: Type, control, complications (renal, eye, CV)  
- **PMH**: Especially vascular disease  

### Examination  

#### General Foot Appearance  
- Charcot foot: dry, warm, swollen, bounding pulses  
  - May resemble infection  
- General motor exam for large muscle groups  

#### Deformities  
- Claw toes – fixed or flexible  
- Plantar callus formation  
- **Silverskiöld test** for Achilles contracture  
  - Increases plantar forefoot pressures  
  - May require release for treatment  
- Other deformities – hallux valgus, etc.  

#### Establishing Peripheral Neuropathy  
- **Semmes-Weinstein testing**  
  - Monofilament testing at multiple locations  
  - 10g filament commonly used  
  - Absence of response to 5.07 filament indicates neuropathy  
- **Two-point discrimination & vibration testing**  
- **Light and sharp touch testing**  

#### Ulcer Examination  
- Clear surrounding callus to expose ulcer  
- Assess discharge – pus, blood, etc.  
- Probe with sterile instrument – if down to bone, 67% chance of osteomyelitis  

#### Vascular Examination  
- **Pulses**  
  - May be bounding due to calcified arteries & sympathetic neuropathy  
  - Absence is a poor indicator – use Doppler  
- **ABPI**  
  - >0.8 is normal  
  - >0.45 required for wound healing  
- **Transcutaneous oxygen saturation**  
  - 40 is normal, <25 indicates high breakdown risk  

## Investigations  

### Blood Tests  
- **FBC, CRP, U&E, HbA1c**  
  - CRP, ESR, and WCC may be elevated in infection or Charcot  
  - Poor differentiators individually  
  - Trends useful in established infection  
- **HbA1c**  
  - Indicates glucose control over past 3 months  
  - Normal upper limit ~6.5%  

### Imaging  
- **X-rays (standing AP, lateral, oblique)**  
  - Established osteomyelitis visible  
  - Charcot stages 1-3 clearly apparent  
- **MRI**  
  - Useful for early osteomyelitis but high false positive rate  
  - Good for abscess detection  
- **Bone scan**  
  - Increased uptake in early Charcot before X-ray findings  
  - Poor specificity for infection vs. Charcot vs. osteomyelitis  
- **WBC-labeled scan**  
  - More specific for osteomyelitis  
- **PET scan**  
  - Sensitive but expensive and not widely available  

## Diagnosing Infection  
- Exposed bone through an ulcer is likely osteomyelitis until proven otherwise  
- Superficial cultures are unreliable due to polymicrobial contamination  
- **Bone biopsy is the gold standard**  

## Differentiating Between Infection and Charcot  
- **Main differentiator: presence of an ulcer**  
- If no ulcer, infection is highly unlikely  
- Infection in diabetics is contiguous, not haematogenous  
- PET, MRI, or WBC-labeled scan may help  
- **Bone biopsy is the gold standard**  

## Management  

### Prevention  
- Education, accommodative footwear, padding for high-risk feet, good diabetic control  

### Simple Non-Infected Ulcers  
- Optimize **diabetic control**  
- Optimize **vascular perfusion**  
- **Offload the ulcer**  
- **Reduce mechanical risk factors**  
- **Total Contact Cast (TCC)** is ideal for offloading  
- Consider Achilles lengthening or claw toe correction if contributing  

**Risk Factors for Treatment Failure:**  
- Large ulcers (>2 cm)  
- Wagner Grade 3 ulcers (deep with abscess/osteomyelitis)  
- Ulcer duration >2 months  
- Mechanical risk factors (clawing, equinus contracture)  

### Infected Ulcers  
- **Optimize diabetic control & vascular flow before surgery**  
- **Treatment ladder:**  
  1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics  
  2. Debridement and abscess drainage  
  3. Debridement of osteomyelitis  
  4. Ray amputations  
  5. Lisfranc amputation  
  6. Chopart amputation (if performed, dorsiflexors must be reattached)  
  7. Below-knee amputation (BKA)  

### Charcot Management  

#### Early Disease  
- Goal: minimize deformity progression  
- **Diabetic control** slows progression  
- **Total contact casting** to limit deformities  
- **Consider surgical fusion** if early instability  
- **Hindfoot nail fusion** for hindfoot and ankle involvement  

#### Chronic Charcot  
- Non-operative preferred  
  - Good diabetic control, education, accommodative footwear  
- Surgical indications:  
  1. Recurrent ulceration  
  2. Instability  
  3. Pain  
  4. Dysfunction due to deformity  
- Surgical options:  
  - Exostectomy  
  - Corrective osteotomy  
  - Fusion with osteotomy  
  - Amputation proximal to Charcot disease
