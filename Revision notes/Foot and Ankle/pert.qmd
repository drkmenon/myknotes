## Two Main Types of Problems  
1. **Degenerate Tears**  
   - Usually *Peroneus Brevis* just distal to fibula  
   - *Peroneus Longus* tears occur as longus hooks under cuboid at the *Os Peroneum*  
   
2. **Instability due to tears of the Superior Peroneal Retinaculum (SPR)**  
   - **Acute tears**  
     - Rare occurrence  

---

## Pathoanatomy  
- *PB* and *PL* originate from the posterior aspect of the fibula  
- *PB* is always closest to bone  
- Both pass over the **Calcaneofibular ligament (CFL)**  
- Stabilized by the **superior and inferior peroneal retinaculum**  
- Lie in a groove on the posterior aspect of fibula  
- Inferior to SPR, they are separated by **peroneal tubercle** on calcaneus  
- **Insertion Points**:  
  - *PB* inserts on **5th MT base**  
  - *PL* runs in **cuboid groove** to insert on **1st MT base**  
- **Functions**:  
  - Both *evert* the **subtalar joint (STJ)** and *dorsiflex* the ankle  
  - *PB* has a **hypovascular zone** just distal to fibula, *PL* at the **inferior peroneal retinaculum (IPR)**

## Tears  

### **Peroneus Brevis (PB)**  
- Occur at level of or just below **Superior Peroneal Retinaculum**  
- **3 times more common** than PL tears  
- **Highly associated** with lateral ankle sprains  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - Abrasion on fibula edge  
  - Compression against fibula by PL  
- Usually **longitudinal intrasubstance tears**  
- **10% are complete tears**  

### **Peroneus Longus (PL)**  
- Occur between **IPR and cuboid base** on lateral aspect of calcaneus  
- **Highly associated with Pes Cavus** (varus hindfoot position)  
- **XR may show**:  
  - Retracted *Os Peroneum*  
  - Fractured *Os Peroneum*  
- Usually **longitudinal tears**  
- **10% are complete**  
- **10% involve both tendons**  

---

## Instability  
- **Tearing of the SPR** causes lateral instability of both tendons  
- **Strongly associated with**:  
  - Ankle instability  
  - Shallow fibula groove predisposing to subluxation  

---

## Clinical Features  
- **History of injury**  
- **Popping or clicking** on lateral aspect  
- **Pain well localized** normally  
- **Visible subluxation if instability** – reproducible by patient  
- **Test Power**:  
  - *PB* – Resisted **eversion with ankle plantarflexed**  
  - *PL* – Resisted **eversion and 1st ray dorsiflexion**  
- **Screen for**:  
  - Pes cavus (may need correction)  
  - Ankle instability  

---

## Imaging  

### **X-Ray (XR)**  
- May show **fractured or displaced Os Peroneum**  
- **SPR rupture** may avulse a small piece of fibula  

### **MRI**  
- Shows **longitudinal tears** as **high signal within tendon**  

### **Arthrography of Ankle**  
- **Dye seeping into peroneal tendons** indicates rupture of CFL  

---

## Management  

### **Non-Operative**  
- Symptomatic  
- **Corrective insoles** if underlying flexible pes cavus  
- **Bracing if concurrent ankle instability**  
- **Physiotherapy**  

---

## Surgical Treatment of Tears  

### **Peroneus Brevis (PB)**  
- **>50% tendon remaining** → *Repair or tubularize*  
- **<50% tendon remaining** → *Debride and attach to peroneus longus*  
- **Complete Tears**:  
  - Repair early or  
  - Sewn to PL  
  - Bridged with **Plantaris graft**  
  - **FHL or FDL transfer**  

### **Peroneus Longus (PL)**  
- **If Os Peroneum fracture** → *Excise*  
- **Treat longus tears** as per Brevis algorithm  

### **Both Tendons Completely Torn**  
- **Bridge graft (plantaris) or tendon transfer of FHL/FDL**  

---

## Surgical Treatment of Instability  
- **Anatomic repair of SPR** with **suture anchors**  
- **Concurrent deepening of peroneal groove** on posterior aspect fibula if shallow  
- **If chronic and SPR irreparable**:  
  - Use **plantaris graft** to replace retinaculum  
- **Treat ankle instability through the same incision if necessary**
