## Ligamentous Stabilisers of the Ankle  

### **Lateral Ligaments**  
- **ATFL** – Primary restraint to anterior translation, especially if foot not plantigrade  
- **CFL** – Restraint to varus force – lies deep to peronei  
- **PTFL** – Strongest and least ruptured of the three lateral ligaments  
- **SPR** – At level of lateral malleolus – rupture = peroneal instability  
- **IPR** – Continuation of IER, stabilises peronei distally  
- **IER** – Y-shaped, vertical limb crosses ankle & STJ – weak stabiliser  
- **AITFL** – Stabilises inferior tibiofibular joint – most commonly injured  
- **PITFL** – Stronger than AITFL and less commonly injured  
- **IOTFL** – Proximal extent is IOM  

### **Talocalcaneal Ligaments**  
- Lateral, interosseus, and cervical – stabilise talus in and around sinus tarsi  

### **Deltoid Ligament**  
- **Superficial** – Fan-shaped, attaching to navicular, calcaneus, and talus  
- **Deep** – More important for stability, attaches only to talus  

### **Spring Ligament**  
- Runs under sustentaculum from calcaneus to navicular like a sling  
- Has **superior & inferior** portions  
- Supports **TNJ and medial arch**  

### **Posterior Structures**  
- **Intermalleolar Ligament** – Between malleoli at level of joint  
- **PITFL** – Strongest stabiliser of the syndesmosis, least frequently torn  
- **PTFL** – Lies on posterior aspect, rarely injured  
- **Posterior Talar Tubercle** – If fails to ossify, forms an *Os Trigonum*, can impinge

## Ankle Movements  
- **Axis of motion** is between malleoli – oblique  
- Ankle is most stable on **axial loading and plantigrade** – congruent bones  
- **On dorsiflexion**:  
  - Fibula **externally rotates 11 degrees** & moves slightly proximal  
  - To accommodate wedge-shaped talus and oblique axis  

---

## Classification of Instability  
- **Most useful classification**:  
  - **Functional Instability** – Feeling of giving way or actual giving way but with no clinical laxity  
  - **Mechanical Instability** – Clinically reproducible laxity – may or may not be symptomatic  

---

## Risk Factors for Instability  

### **Hindfoot Varus**  
- **Most important predisposing factor** for recurrent lateral instability  
- **Main cause of surgical failure** is not recognising varus  

### **Equinus**  
- **Inability to get foot plantigrade** means ATFL is constantly working  
- Can lead to **chronic rupture or incompetence**  

### **Hindfoot Valgus**  
- Less common than varus but can cause chronic **medial instability**  

### **Other Risk Factors**  
- **Pivoting Sports**  
- **Obesity**  
- **Hyperlaxity**

## Clinical Features  

### **History**  
- Acute, chronic, or acute on chronic  
- What actually happens on *giving way*?  
- Number of episodes  
- Are they painful?  
- Treatment history  
- **Symptoms**:  
  - Locking, clicking, or giving way  
  - Global hyperlaxity  

### **Examination**  
- **Beighton’s Score** – for hyperlaxity  
- **Screen for deformity** – varus, valgus, or equinus  
- **Passive ROM** – is there pain or stiffness?  
- **Palpation** – lateral, medial & syndesmotic ligaments for pain  
- **Joint line pain** – synovitis from chronic impingement  
- **Evidence of peroneal subluxation**  

### **Special Tests**  
- **Anterior Draw** – Tests ATFL  
  - 30° plantar flexion, fix tibia, and draw hindfoot forward  
  - *Positive* if sulcus appears or more laxity than the other side  
- **Tilt Test** – Primarily for lateral laxity  
  - Ankle plantigrade, STJ locked, apply **varus stress**  
  - *Valgus stress* will test medial structures  
- **Syndesmosis Stability**  
  - **Squeeze Test** – Useful in acute injuries, pain over AITFL  
  - **External Rotation Test** – More useful in chronic injury  
    - Foot plantigrade, hanging off couch, knee flexed  
    - Fix tibia and externally rotate foot  
    - *Positive* if increased rotation or pain → impingement

## Imaging  

### **X-Ray (XR)**  
- **Standing AP and Lateral Views** – Show **mortise reduction**  
- **Stress Views** – May be useful  
- **Plain X-rays miss 50% of OCDs**  

### **MRI**  
- **Indicated in**:  
  - Non-recovering ankle sprains at **4-8 weeks**  
  - Chronic instability cases with pain → may have **OC lesion**  
- **Arthrogram** – Probably better than plain MRI

## Management  

### **Acute Injuries & Instability**  
- **No evidence** to support **acute ligament repair** over non-operative treatment  
- **Evidence-based approach**:  

#### **Minor Stable Sprains**  
- **RICE**, early **weight-bearing (WB)**, and ROM  

#### **Severe Stable Sprains**  
- **Physiotherapy** – muscle rehab and proprioceptive training  

#### **Severe Unstable Sprains**  
- Diagnosed by a clinician  
- **Supportive brace + early WB with physiotherapy**  
- **MRI if no improvement after 4-6 weeks** to rule out OCD

## Chronic Instability  

- **Patients with functional instability** often improve with **arthroscopy**  
  - Instability often due to **intra-articular pathology**  
- **Patients with true mechanical instability** can be offered **stabilisation**  

### **Good Practice Approach**  
1. Perform **Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA)**  
2. **Arthroscopy** – improves many cases  
3. If no improvement & mechanical instability → **Stabilisation Procedure**

## Stabilisation Procedures  

### **Brostrum (with Gould Modification)**  
- **Direct repair of ATFL and CFL**  
- **Techniques**:  
  - **End-to-end repair** or **anchors** depending on ligament tear location  
- **Gould Modification**:  
  - Reinforces with part of the **inferior retinaculum**  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Very good, reproducible long-term result  
  - Preferred as it is an **anatomic repair**  

### **Non-Anatomic Repairs**  
- **Examples**: Evans, Watson Jones, or Sammarco (*actually anatomic*)  
- **Indications**:  
  - **Insufficient ligamentous tissue** for Brostrum  
  - **More robust repair required**:  
    - **Varus hindfoot**  
    - **Severe instability**  
    - **High-demand patient** needing stability at the expense of flexibility  
    - **Ligamentous laxity** (*try to avoid surgery in this group*)  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Splitting **Peroneus Brevis**  
  - Re-rooting the tendon around **talus, fibula, and calcaneus**  
  - Uses **anchors or drill holes**  
- **Outcomes**:  
  - Good results  
  - Robust  
  - **Not as anatomic** as Brostrum – may alter ankle kinematics and stiffen
