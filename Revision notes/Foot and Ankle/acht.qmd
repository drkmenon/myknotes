## Epidemiology  
- Usually middle-aged individuals involved in sports  

## Aetiology  
- **Non-Insertional (2-6cm from insertion)** – most common  
- **Insertional (<2cm from insertion)** – often associated with **Haglund’s deformity**  
- **Retrocalcaneal Bursitis** – may co-exist with insertional tendinopathy  
- **Peritendinitis** – inflammation of the paratenon only  
  - Hard to differentiate from non-insertional clinically  

## Pathoanatomy  
- An **enthesiopathy** similar to other areas in the body  
- **Fibrocartilaginous metaplasia** with collagen fiber disorganization, hypercellularity, and neovascularization  
- **Attritional tears** and **intra-tendinous calcification** may be found  
- **Non-insertional tendinopathy** occurs in a **watershed area of blood supply**  
  - Located **2-6 cm** from insertion on the **posterior calcaneal tuberosity**  

## Incidence of Rupture  
- No proven evidence that **tendinosis** is a **prelude to rupture**  
- However, they can **occur together**  
- Ruptured tendons in **asymptomatic individuals** show the **same histopathology** as tendinosis  

## Achilles Biomechanics  
- **Achilles transfers ~10x body weight** during terminal stance and pre-swing (**3rd rocker**)  

## Clinical Features  
- **Activity-related pain**  
- **Swelling** can be very prominent  
- **Shoe wear** can be uncomfortable  

### Examination  
- **Location of swelling and pain** is the main differentiator  
- **Retrocalcaneal bursitis** has swelling that **doesn’t move with the tendon**  
  - Located **adjacent to either side of the tendon** proximal to insertion  
- **Symmonds test** to check for tendon continuity  

## Investigations  

### X-ray  
- May show **Haglund’s deformity** associated with **insertional tendinopathy**  
- **Calcaneal cystic changes** consistent with insertional tendinopathy  

### MRI  
- **Not usually necessary**  
- May show:  
  - **Longitudinal intratendinous splits**  
  - **Intratendinous calcification and hypovascularity**  
  - **Retrocalcaneal bursal or insertional high signal**  

## Non-Surgical Management  
- **Activity modification**  
- **Heel raise**  
- **Padding around the heel**  
- **Eccentric exercise programme** – especially for **non-insertional tendinopathy**  
- **Steroid injections**  
  - Avoid **into tendon or paratenon**  
  - Consider for **retrocalcaneal bursitis**  
- **Platelet injections** – unproven but may be tried in **non-insertional tendinopathy**  

## Surgical Management  

### Non-Insertional  
- **Debridement** of **tendon and paratenon**  
- **Excision of calcifications**  
- If **>50% debridement** required → **FHL/plantaris tendon transfer**  

### Insertional  
- **Debride tendon**  
- **Excise Haglund’s deformity** if present  
- **Re-attach tendon** using **anchors or drill holes**  

### Dealing with Tendon Deficiency  
- **VY plasty**  
- **Achilles turndown**  
- **Allograft**  
- **FHL transfer**
