![Trade off between health span and life span](images/exercise.png)

AMP kinase is believed to be the central switch that positively regulate the life span of an individual.

It is up regulated by (via SIRT 1):

-   Aerobic exercise

-   Starvation

-   Decreased protein intake

mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin, is central in building muscle mass. Muscle mass is important for healthy ageing, i.e., health span.

mTOR is up regulated by:

-   Animal protein

-   Strengthening exercises

One important role of mTOR is to inhibit AMP kinase, there by negatively affecting the life span.

This cell level interplay has got important practical implications.

-   Aerobic exercises go with low protein diet and starvation

-   Strengthening exercises go with high protein intake

-   One should not mix aerobic with strengthening exercises. There should be at least 12 hrs. gap between them.

-   Lot of animal protein and strengthening exercises will increase muscle mass. But the same has got negative affect on life span.

-   Hence, limit animal protein and strengthening exercises to 2 days per week. Rest of the days, take less protein and do aerobic exercises.

## **Strengthening exercise**

-   Regular repeated weight lifting for a fixed period of time, say, 30 minutes.

## **Aerobic exercise**

-   150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of high intensity aerobic exercise are both beneficial

## Barbell approach

It is fair to assume that our genes have not yet evolved enough to process an abundance of food and a total lack of physical exertion. Cavemen were accustomed to bouts of physical exertion (for food, mates, and escaping enemies) and sporadic feasts with prolonged periods of an empty stomach.

Emulating eating and exercise patterns in line with our ancestors could be promising.
