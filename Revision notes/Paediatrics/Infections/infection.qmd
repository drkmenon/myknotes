## Paediatric Acute Osteomyelitis

### Epidemiology

-   Boys \> Girls
-   \<10 years old
-   Neonatal infections are more aggressive with higher complications.
-   Acute osteomyelitis is the most common presenting form.

### Aetiology

-   **Usually acute haematogenous spread**:
    -   Direct inoculation (trauma, varicella, or other bacteraemia).
-   **Infection originates in metaphysis**:
    -   Metaphyseal vessels are end arteries, with slow capillary blood flow allowing bacterial seeding.
    -   Localised infection activates osteoclasts, causing necrosis and purulent exudate.
    -   Subperiosteal abscess forms, spreading toward the diaphysis, leading to sequestrum formation.
    -   Periosteum attempts to wall off necrotic bone (involucrum), progressing to chronic osteomyelitis if untreated.

### Risk Factors

-   Local trauma.
-   Immunocompromise (diabetes, renal disease, chemotherapy/steroids, rheumatoid conditions).
-   Most cases occur in otherwise healthy children.

### Pathogens

-   **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common across all age groups.
-   **MRSA**: Higher virulence, multifocal osteomyelitis, abscess formation.
-   **Special Situations**:
    -   Sickle Cell: Salmonella.
    -   Shoe Puncture: Pseudomonas.
    -   Neonates: Group B Streptococcus.
    -   Infants: Group A Streptococcus, Haemophilus (if unvaccinated).
    -   Varicella: Streptococcus.

### Clinical Evaluation

-   **History**: Trauma, immunisations, systemic symptoms, pain, fever.
-   **Examination**: Pain site, cardiac assessment, septic arthritis, weight-bearing status.

### Investigations

1.  **Bloods**:
    -   CRP rises after 6 hours.
    -   ESR rises after 3 days.
    -   WCC: Variable elevation.
    -   Blood cultures: \~30% yield (collect from 3 sites during temperature spikes).
2.  **Imaging**:
    -   X-ray: Changes visible after 7–14 days.
    -   Bone Scan: 90% sensitivity for multifocal osteomyelitis.
    -   MRI: High sensitivity, lower specificity; good for surgical planning and subperiosteal abscess diagnosis.
3.  **Aspiration**:
    -   Gold standard diagnostic test.
    -   Aspirate fluid for microbiology and histology.

### Management Principles

-   **Establish diagnosis** and rule out underlying causes.
-   Start **antibiotics** empirically after aspiration or earlier in toxic children.
-   Antibiotics are sufficient in most cases if:
    -   Early diagnosis (\<3 days).
    -   No periosteal abscess.
    -   Standard pathogens.
    -   Clinical improvement within 72 hours.

#### Surgical Indications

-   Subperiosteal abscess or frank pus on aspiration.
-   Failure to improve with antibiotics.
-   Chronic osteomyelitis with sequestrum.

#### Surgical Technique

-   Drain abscess, debride necrotic tissue, and decompress bone to prevent further damage.
-   Avoid violating other compartments unnecessarily.

## Subacute Osteomyelitis

### Features

-   Subtle presentation (e.g., limp, pain).
-   Normal inflammatory markers.
-   Positive imaging (bone scan, X-ray, MRI).

### Brodie’s Abscess

-   **Aetiology**: Low virulence pathogen and fit host.
-   **Features**: Lytic area with a sclerotic rim.
-   **Management**:
    -   Biopsy to rule out bone tumours.
    -   Similar treatment to acute osteomyelitis.

## Septic Arthritis

### Epidemiology

-   More common than osteomyelitis in children.
-   75% of cases occur in children under 5 years old.

### Aetiology

-   Haematogenous seeding, contiguous spread, or direct inoculation.
-   Large joints (hip \> knee) are most commonly affected.

### Pathophysiology

-   Proteolytic enzymes degrade hyaline cartilage within 8 hours.
-   Secondary effects: AVN, physeal growth arrest.

### Diagnosis

-   **Kocher’s Criteria**:

    1.  Temperature \>38.5°C.
    2.  ESR \>40 mm/hr.
    3.  Non-weight-bearing.
    4.  WCC \>12,000/mm³.

    -   Presence of 3–4 criteria is 93–99% predictive of septic arthritis.

### Management

-   Withhold antibiotics until aspiration.
-   Perform arthrotomy, irrigate, and leave the joint open or with a drain.

## Special Situations

### Neonates

-   Immature immune response increases susceptibility.
-   Pathogens: Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus.
-   **Management**: Early aspiration and surgical drainage.

### Sickle Cell Disease

-   Increased risk of osteomyelitis due to infarcts and slow blood flow.
-   Pathogens: Salmonella, but Staphylococcus aureus remains most common.

### Tuberculosis

-   Skeletal TB accounts for \~3% of cases in children (spine \> hip/knee \> long bones).
-   Diagnosis via biopsy and acid-fast bacilli staining.
-   Management includes surgical drainage and multi-drug therapy.

### Lyme Disease

-   Pathogen: Borrelia burgdorferi.
-   Features: Arthritis with bulls-eye rash and cardiac arrhythmias.
-   Treatment with antibiotics.

### Gonococcal Arthritis

-   Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adolescents, child abuse cases, perinatal transmission).
-   **Management**: Use specialized culture media (e.g., chocolate agar).

## Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO)

-   **Epidemiology**: Girls \> Boys.
-   **Features**: Waxing and waning bone pain, low-grade fever.
-   **Management**: Exclude malignancy; treat with NSAIDs or biopsy if necessary.
