## Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

### Definition

-   Progressive muscle weakness in young boys
-   X-linked recessive

### Clinical Features

-   Clumsy walking
-   Reduced motor skills
-   **Pseudohypertrophy of the calf** (classic) – connective tissue infiltration
-   Scoliosis
-   Respiratory difficulty in advanced stages
-   **Gower’s sign**:
    -   Rises by walking hands up thighs to compensate for quadriceps and gluteal weakness
    -   First affected area is gluteals

### Diagnosis

-   **DNA Testing**: Absent Dystrophin protein
-   **High Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK)**
-   **Muscle Biopsy**:
    -   Absent Dystrophin (diagnostic)
    -   Connective tissue infiltration and muscle necrosis

### Management

#### Non-Surgical

-   Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy (OT)
-   High-dose steroids:
    -   Prolong ambulation
    -   Slow scoliosis progression
-   Complications:
    -   Overnight ventilatory support

#### Surgical

-   Controversial due to:
    -   High anesthetic risks
    -   Questionable benefit
    -   **Malignant Hyperthermia** – intra-operative dantrolene
-   Specific Procedures:
    -   Release of knee contractures: May prolong ambulation by 1–2 years
    -   Scoliosis:
        -   Rapid progression as muscles weaken
        -   Long fusion recommended at \>20° curvature to address thoracic compromise

### Outcomes

-   Unable to walk independently by 10 years
-   Wheelchair-bound by 14 years
-   Bedridden by 16 years
-   Death by cardiopulmonary compromise by 20 years

## Becker’s Muscular Dystrophy

### Characteristics

-   X-linked recessive
-   Associated with **red/green color blindness**

### Clinical Features

-   Similar to Duchenne but less severe

### Diagnosis

-   **Muscle Biopsy**:
    -   Reduced but not absent Dystrophin

### Outcomes

-   Survival beyond 22 years is indicative of Becker’s Muscular Dystrophy

## Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy

### Characteristics

-   Autosomal dominant

### Clinical Features

-   Facial muscle abnormalities
-   Shoulder girdle weakness
-   Normal Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK)
-   Bilateral scapula winging

### Management

-   **Scapulothoracic Fusion**: For symptomatic cases
