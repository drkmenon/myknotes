### Likely Pathologic Varus

-   **Unilateral**
-   **Severe**
    -   2SD outside selenius curve
-   **IM distance \>15 cm at 5 years**
-   **Varus present over 2 years old**
-   **Obese child**
-   **Wider developmental abnormality evident**

### Likely Pathologic Valgus

-   **Unilateral**
-   **Severe**
    -   IM distance \>10cm at 10 years
-   **Progressive deformity**

## Genu Varus Causes

-   **Blount’s Disease**
-   **Rickets** (all types)
-   **Achondroplasia**
-   **Tibial Hemimelia**
-   **Osteogenesis Imperfecta**

## Genu valgus causes

-   **Morquio Syndrome**

-   **Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED)**

-   **Cozen’s fracture**

-   **Hypophosphataemic Rickets**

-   **Physiologic**

## Both

-   **Multiple hereditary osteochondromatosis**
-   **Infection**
-   **Trauma**

### Blount’s Disease

#### Epidemiology

-   Most common paediatric cause of tibia vara

#### Aetiology

-   Obesity – overload on medial tibial physis restricts growth
-   There is varus but also internal rotation deformity

#### Classification

-   **Infantile or Adolescent**
    -   Infantile is more aggressive with worse outcomes.
-   **Langenskiöld Classification**
    -   6 stages based on the appearance of the medial physis
    -   Grade 1 & 2 are mild
    -   Grade 5 & 6 are severe with joint depression

#### Evaluation

-   **Differentiate between physiologic bowing and Blount’s:**
    -   Physiologic bowing:
        -   Milder
        -   Spread across whole tibia, not at physis
        -   Will not progress
        -   Will not cause pain
        -   Always bilateral

#### Investigations

-   **X-Ray if:**
    -   Progressive bowing
    -   Walking age child with \>20-degree varus
    -   Short stature or family history of metabolic bone disease

#### Management

-   **Primary Aim:** Restore mechanical axis
-   **Secondary Aims:**
    -   Elevate joint depression
    -   Equalize limb lengths
    -   Prevent complications (e.g., compartment syndrome)
-   **Non-Operative:**
    -   Grade 1 or 2 initially
    -   Appropriate for \<4 years if not severe
-   **Operative:**
    -   Osteotomy (Infantile: Long oblique; Adolescent: Dome or medial opening wedge)

## Genu Valgum

### Causes

-   **Physiologic**
-   **Obesity**
-   **Cozen’s fracture**
-   **Hypophosphataemic rickets**
-   **Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia**
-   **Tumour**
-   **Infection**

### Management

-   **Non-Operative:**
    -   Reassure and observe if physiologic and asymptomatic
-   **Surgical:**
    -   **Guided Growth:** Lateral physis tethering (8-plate or staples)
    -   **Hemiepiphysiodesis:** Permanent correction
    -   **Osteotomy:** For older children or residual deformity

## Tibial Bowing

### Types

-   **Posteromedial Bowing**
    -   Physiologic; resolves spontaneously
    -   Complication: Leg length discrepancy
-   **Anterolateral Bowing**
    -   Associated with congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia
    -   Management: Nailing, Ilizarov, or amputation if severe
-   **Anteromedial Bowing**
    -   Associated with fibula hemimelia

## Paediatric Limb Length Discrepancy

### Aetiology

-   **Congenital or Acquired:**
    -   Dwarfism, neuromuscular, PFFD, infection, trauma, etc.

### Management

-   **\<2 cm:** No treatment or shoe raise
-   **2–5 cm:** Epiphysiodesis or lengthening
-   **5–15 cm:** Lengthening or amputation
-   **\>15 cm:** Amputation and prosthetics preferred

## Paediatric Rotational Abnormalities

### Femoral Torsion

-   **Normal Variants:**
    -   Anteversion reduces from 40° at birth to 15° at skeletal maturity
-   **Management:**
    -   Reassurance for physiologic cases
    -   Surgical rotational osteotomy if severe

### Tibial Torsion

-   **Aetiology:**
    -   Packaging disorder or neuromuscular
-   **Management:**
    -   Resolves spontaneously; surgery if symptomatic in children \>10 years
