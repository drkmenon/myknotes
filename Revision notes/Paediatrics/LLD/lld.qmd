title: "Limb Length Discrepancy"
---

## Epidemiology

-   Common to have small inequalities \<2cm – asymptomatic

## Aetiology

-   **Congenital or Acquired**
    -   Dwarfism, Neuromuscular, PFFD, CSF, etc.
    -   Infection, Physeal trauma, Tumour, AVN
-   **True or Apparent**
    -   Always screen for:
        -   Scoliosis
        -   Hip, knee, ankle soft tissue contracture
    -   Most common: Hip adductor contracture – apparent shortening
-   **Proportional or Disproportional**
    -   **Proportional**: 70% discrepancy remains consistent at maturity (congenital)
    -   **Disproportionate**: Discrepancy varies with growth (acquired conditions)

## Potential Problems from Limb Length Discrepancy

-   Limp – main focus of intervention is to cure limp
-   Psychologic distress
-   Back pain – no evidence
-   Early osteoarthritis (OA) – uncovered femoral head on long side & increased joint reaction forces (debatable)

## Methods of Predicting Growth

### Rule of Thumb Method

-   Girls stop growing at 14 years, boys stop at 16 years
-   Mean limb length (LL) at maturity:
    -   Female: 80cm
    -   Male: 85cm
-   Growth predicted by mean yearly growth at each physis:
    -   **Distal Tibia**: 3mm/year
    -   **Proximal Tibia**: 6mm/year
    -   **Distal Femur**: 9mm/year
    -   **Proximal Femur**: 3mm/year
-   Most applicable to the last 4 years of growth.

### Predicted Height at Maturity

-   **TW3 formula**: More applicable to boys.
-   If predicted height is short, consider **lengthening** instead of **epiphysiodesis**.

### Linear Growth Estimates

-   Sufficient for most conditions, even disproportionate LLD.
-   Common methods:
    -   Green & Anderson Tables
    -   Mosley Graphs
    -   Paley Multiplier Method (accounts for gender)

### Non-Linear Growth Estimates

-   Eastwood Method
-   Shapiro Method

## Clinical Evaluation

### Examination

-   Pelvic tilt
-   Limp
-   Compensatory gait pattern – vaulting, toe walking, knee flexion
-   Compensatory scoliosis

### Block Test

-   Examine from behind with knees extended.
-   Stack blocks under the shorter limb until pelvis is level.
-   As accurate as imaging measurements.

### Supine Measurement

-   Measure limb lengths supine (estimation only – less accurate).

### Imaging

-   Single long cassette X-ray of both lower limbs (Weight Bearing - WB)
-   CT scanogram (Non-WB)
-   X-ray scanogram (3 small cassettes stitched together - WB preferred)

### Additional Tests

-   All children with congenital LLD should undergo **abdomen ultrasound**.
    -   6% incidence of neuroectodermal tumours (e.g., Wilms tumour).

## Management

### General Principles of Lengthening

-   Do not lengthen \>15% of residual limb length in one sitting.
-   Best done at metaphysis:
    -   Less non-union
    -   Easier access
-   Rate: 1mm/day in 3-4 slots.
-   Start lengthening 5-7 days after corticotomy.
-   Leave fixator on for at least the same time as the lengthening period.
-   For very long discrepancies (\>15cm), **amputation** and prosthetic fitting may provide better outcomes.

### Acute Shortening

-   For discrepancies of 2-5cm, shortening is an option, especially in the upper limb.
-   Most predictable when performed after skeletal maturity.

### Epiphysiodesis

-   Performed with a drill – no plating required.
-   Predictable and easy to perform.

### Physeal Bar Excision

-   More reliable in post-traumatic than post-infection cases.
-   Indicated if:
    -   \<50% of the physis is affected.
    -   2cm discrepancy or at least 2 years of growth left.
-   Shortening or epiphysiodesis may be easier and more reliable.

## Options Based on Limb Length Discrepancy

| LLD Range | Management Options |
|----|----|
| \<2cm | No treatment or shoe raise |
| 2-5cm | Epiphysiodesis, shortening, or lengthening (if predicted height is short) |
| 5-15cm | Epiphysiodesis, lengthening, shortening, or both |
| \>15cm | Lengthening or amputation and prosthetic fitting |
