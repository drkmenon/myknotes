title: "Limb Deficiencies"

## Fibula Hemimelia

### Aetiology

-   No inheritance pattern.
-   Most common of limb deficiencies.
-   Post-axial hypoplasia.
-   Variable length of fibula missing (partial to complete).
-   Often no syndromic disorder; children are intellectually normal.
-   Variable expression (mild to severe).
-   Strongly associated with multiple other limb deformities/deficiencies.

### Classification

-   **Achterman & Kalamachi**
    -   Traditional classification based on the amount of fibula present.
    -   Type 2: More likely to have concurrent deficiencies.
-   **Birch Classification**
    -   Based on foot and limb function.
    -   Guides treatment.

### Clinical Presentation

-   **Birth presentation**:
    -   Valgus ankle.
    -   Anteromedial bow of tibia with skin puckering.
    -   Proportionate limb length discrepancy (LLD remains same ratio at maturity).

#### Features to Look for in Assessment:

| Area | Features |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hip & Femur** | CSF, PFFD, Shortening |
| **Knee** | ACL (and PCL) deficiency, Valgus (hypoplastic LFC), Patella maltracking/hypoplasia |
| **Leg** | Anteromedial bowing, Skin puckering, Shortening |
| **Ankle** | Valgus (rarely varus), Ball-and-socket ankle |
| **Foot** | Tarsal coalition, Absent lateral rays, Syndactyly of remaining toes |

### Management

-   Treatment dictated by other bones and soft tissues, not the fibula.
-   Preserve/correct knee for prosthetic fitting.
-   **Salvage vs. Amputation**:
    -   

        > 3 absent rays: Better outcome with amputation.

    -   Flail foot: Perform amputation (Symes) before age 3 for less psychological impact.
-   Address individual problems as necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency (PFFD)

### Definition

-   Spectrum of disease:
    -   **Congenital Shortening of the Femur (CSF)**: Mild, normal hip development.
    -   **Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency (PFFD)**: Severe, no proximal femur (head may be present).
    -   Limb is very short.

### Aetiology

-   Non-hereditary, unknown cause.

### Associated Problems

-   More likely syndromic.
-   High incidence of other deficiencies (50%):
    -   Fibula hemimelia (50-70%).
    -   Upper limb deficiencies.
    -   Hip dysplasia.
    -   Coxa vara.

### Management

#### Principles

-   Decision based on:
    -   Hip dysplasia/stability.
    -   Function and muscle bulk of the lower leg.
    -   Bone deficiencies.
    -   Knee and ankle stability/contracture.
    -   Presence of proximal femur or femoral head.
    -   Importance of feet (for ADLs if upper limbs are deficient).

#### Options

1.  **Lengthening**
    -   Predicted discrepancy \<20 cm with functional lower leg.
    -   Address acetabular dysplasia/coxa vara before lengthening.
    -   Use distraction osteogenesis with external fixator.
2.  **Knee Fusion and Foot Ablation**
    -   Non-functional ankle: Fusion for better prosthetic fit.
3.  **Van Ness Rotationplasty**
    -   Rotate functional ankle to act as knee joint in a prosthesis.
4.  **Femoro-pelvic Fusion (Brownâ€™s Procedure)**
    -   For non-functional hip and proximal femur.
5.  **Prosthetic Fitting**
    -   Required in all cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tibial Hemimelia

### Key Facts

-   Less common than fibula hemimelia: 1/million.
-   Clinical presentation:
    -   75% have other anomalies.
    -   Equinovarus foot (rare in other conditions).
    -   Variable tibial deficiency.
    -   Grossly unstable ankle and knee.

### Associations

-   Pre-axial polydactyly.
-   Lobster claw hand.
-   PFFD.

### Management

-   Depends on knee extension:
    -   If knee extends, consider reconstruction.
    -   If not, use prosthesis after foot ablation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Clinical Assessment of a Limb Deficiency

### Examination

1.  **Standing (Front, Side, Back)**
    -   Scars, shortening, angular deformity, muscle wasting, skin changes, spine assessment.
2.  **Palpation**
    -   ASIS height, block test for pelvic leveling.
3.  **Gait Analysis**
    -   Observe compensation for shortening (e.g., equinus, vaulting, circumduction).
4.  **Lie Down**
    -   Square pelvis, check angular deformities and bony landmarks.
5.  **Range of Motion**
    -   Joint ROM, stiffness, correctibility of deformities, joint instability (ACL, PCL, MCL).
6.  **Neurological Status**
    -   Examine upper limbs, spine, abdomen.
    -   Obtain full history and limb X-rays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Congenital Pseudoarthrosis of the Tibia (CPT)

### Aetiology

-   Congenital anterolateral bowing of tibia (distal 1/3).
-   Poor bone quality, propensity to fracture.
-   Healing is poor, leading to pseudoarthrosis.

### Epidemiology

-   1/200,000 live births.

### Associations

-   Most commonly linked to Type 1 Neurofibromatosis (50%):
    -   Only 10% of NF patients develop CPT.
-   Fibrous dysplasia.
-   Often idiopathic.

### Types

-   **Boyd Classification (1-6)**:
    -   Based on severity.
    -   Variations include sclerotic, cystic, or string-like tibia, associated fibula pseudoarthrosis, and ankle valgus.

### Differential Diagnosis

-   Osteogenesis imperfecta.
-   Rickets.
-   Fibrous dysplasia.
-   (CPT is almost never bilateral.)

### Management Goals

-   Early diagnosis and fracture prevention.
-   Achieving bony union.
-   Preventing re-fracture.
-   Correcting LLD.

### Non-operative Management

-   If found before fracture:
    -   Splinting (KAFO).
    -   Total contact casting.
    -   Fracture risk reduces after maturity.

### Surgical Options

1.  **IM Nail and Cortical Grafting**
    -   Nail through heel; retained until maturity.
    -   Prevents re-fracture; controls ankle valgus.
    -   Suitable for younger children.
2.  **Ilizarov Technique**
    -   Resection and compression with bone transport.
    -   Corrects LLD; used for failed nailing.
3.  **Vascularised Free Fibula Transfer**
    -   Complex; requires expertise.
    -   No better clinical outcomes.
4.  **Amputation**
    -   After 3 failed union attempts.

### Outcomes

-   70% union rates for all methods.
