title: "Rotational Abnormalities"
---

## Differential Diagnosis

-   Patients commonly present with intoeing.
-   Bilateral equal intoeing is usually a normal variant.
-   **Version**: Within normal limits of rotation.\
-   **Torsion**: Abnormal.

### Main Differential Diagnoses

-   Femoral torsion
-   Tibial torsion
-   Metatarsus adductus
-   Skewfoot

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Normal Variants

### Hips

-   **Femoral Anteversion**
    -   40 degrees at birth
    -   20 degrees at 10 years
    -   15 degrees at skeletal maturity

### Tibia

-   **Thigh-Foot Angle**
    -   -7 degrees at birth

    -   

        > +7 degrees at 7 years

    -   

        > +10 degrees at 10 years

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Femoral Torsion

### Aetiology

-   Physiologic femoral anteversion: 40 degrees at birth.
    -   Reduces to 10-15 degrees by age 10.
    -   Girls have 5 degrees more mean torsion than boys.
-   Retroversion is rare and usually pathologic.
-   Significant anteversion may relate to other conditions, e.g., SUFE.

### Miserable Malalignment Syndrome

-   Femoral anteversion with compensatory tibial external torsion.
-   High incidence of anterior knee pain.

### Clinical Presentation

-   Intoeing
-   Awkward gait
-   Anterior knee pain

### Clinical Examination (Assess 4 Things)

1.  **Foot Progression Angle**
    -   Negative: Anteversion
    -   Positive: Retroversion
2.  **Thigh-Foot Angle (Prone)**
    -   Assesses tibial torsion (\>10 degrees is abnormal).
3.  **Femoral Version (Prone)**
    -   In anteversion: Increased IR, decreased ER.
    -   **Gageâ€™s Test**: Estimate of femoral anteversion by IR of leg until GT is most prominent.
4.  **Foot Borders or Deviation from Foot Bisector Axis**
    -   Lateral convexity: May indicate metatarsus adductus.
    -   Medial convexity: May indicate planovalgus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Management

-   **No treatment required in most cases.**\
-   Reassure parents that anteversion resolves by age 10.

#### Indications for Surgery

-   IR \>70 degrees, ER \<10 degrees, child \>10 years.
-   Very awkward gait.
-   Psychological distress due to appearance (child, not parents).
-   Patellofemoral pain.
-   As part of another condition (e.g., DDH).

### Rotational Osteotomy

-   Types: Intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric, diaphyseal, or supracondylar.
-   Stabilisation:
    -   **IM Nail**: For closed physes.
    -   **Fixed Angle Plate**: For open physes.
-   Union:
    -   Metaphysis: More reliable.
    -   Diaphysis: Also effective in children.
-   **Supracondylar Osteotomy**: For patellofemoral pain or instability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tibial Torsion

### Key Facts

-   Most common cause of intoeing: Internal tibial torsion.
-   Normal tibial torsion: 10 degrees external torsion.

### Aetiology

-   Packaging disorder, associated with metatarsus adductus.
-   May result from neuromuscular disorders.
-   External tibial torsion may compensate for femoral anteversion (miserable malalignment syndrome).

### Clinical Presentation

-   Tripping over feet.
-   Awkward gait.

### Assessment

-   Full rotational profile, including femoral version.
-   Tibial torsion best assessed prone with thigh-foot axis.

### Management

-   **Usually resolves spontaneously.**
-   Surgery (supramalleolar osteotomy) only if symptomatic in children \>10 years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Metatarsus Adductus

### Epidemiology

-   Seen in 12% of newborns.

### Aetiology

-   Adduction of forefoot with normal hindfoot.
-   Packaging problem.
-   Associated with DDH.
-   90% resolve by age 4 years.

### Classification

-   **Bleck Classification**
    -   Based on heel bisector line and stiffness of deformity.

### Diagnosis

-   Clinical evaluation:
    -   Screen for other deformities and associated conditions.
    -   **Tickle Test**: Stimulates peronei and indicates flexibility.
    -   Heel bisector angle:
        -   Normal: Passes between 2nd and 3rd toes.
        -   Metatarsus adductus: Passes more laterally.

### Management

-   **Flexible Deformities**: Passive stretching.
-   **Stiff Deformities (Young Children)**: Serial casting.
-   **Older Children (\>7 Years)**: Surgery.
    -   **Osteotomies**:
        -   Medial column lengthening.
        -   Lateral column shortening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Skewfoot

### Aetiology

-   Uncommon, complex condition.
-   Features:
    -   Forefoot adduction.
    -   Hindfoot valgus.
-   Packaging disorder.

### Management

-   **Most cases are asymptomatic.** Observe.
-   For symptomatic cases:
    -   Non-operative treatment is usually unsuccessful.
    -   Combination of osteotomies required:
        -   Medial sliding calcaneal osteotomy for valgus.
        -   Lateral shortening or medial column lengthening for adduction.
