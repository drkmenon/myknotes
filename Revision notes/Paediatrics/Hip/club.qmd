Talipes Equinovarus, commonly known as Clubfoot, is a congenital deformity involving multiple musculoskeletal structures in the foot and ankle. It presents with a distinctive inward twisting of the foot and affects approximately 1 in 1,000 live births.

## Epidemiology

| Parameter  | Details                                     |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Gender     | Boys \> Girls                               |
| Prevalence | Higher in Polynesians and Black populations |
| Laterality | 50% of cases are bilateral                  |

## Aetiology

Clubfoot’s causes are multifactorial, with several proposed theories:

-   **Neurogenic**: Muscle imbalance potentially leading to deformity
-   **Myogenic**: Anomalous muscles noted in clubfoot
-   **Vascular**: Often accompanied by a short limb and absent anterior tibial artery
-   **Bone Abnormalities**: Primarily affecting talus and calcaneus
-   **Packaging Disorder**: Association with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and metatarsus adductus
-   **Genetic Predisposition**: Family history increases risk
-   **Associated Conditions**: May present alongside hip and spinal issues (screen recommended)

## Subtypes of Clubfoot

| Subtype | Description |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Idiopathic** | No known associated conditions |
| **Neuromuscular** | Related to conditions such as CP, polio, peroneal nerve palsy, spina bifida |
| **Teratologic** | Associated with arthrogryposis and multiple joint contractures |

## Features of the Deformity

The deformity in clubfoot affects the ankle, subtalar, and midtarsal joints. Key components include:

1.  **Ankle**: Equinus position due to gastro-soleus involvement
2.  **Hindfoot**: Varus, inversion, and adduction caused by tibialis posterior contracture, and bony abnormalities in the talus and calcaneus
3.  **Forefoot**: Cavus, adduction, and plantarflexion involving the plantar fascia, adductor hallucis, and flexor hallucis

## Classification: Pirani Score

| Score Element         | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Posterior Folds**   | Medial and posterior creases, linked to severity |
| **Curvature**         | Curvature of the lateral border                  |
| **Calcaneus & Talus** | Palpability indicates severity                   |

-   Scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe and rigid deformities.

## Clinical Presentation

-   Medial-facing sole
-   High-arched heel
-   Shortened limb on the affected side
-   Smaller calf and foot size
-   Screening advised for associated abnormalities (e.g., bone dysplasia, DDH, neurogenic markers)

## Imaging Features

Imaging, although not always required for diagnosis, provides key insights:

| View | Key Indicators |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Lateral (Turco’s)** | Talo-calcaneal angle is 0° in clubfoot |
| **AP (Kite’s Angle)** | Talo-calcaneal angle less than 20° (normally 20-40°) |

## Management Approaches

### Ponseti Method

-   **Indications**: First-line treatment for all clubfoot presentations
-   **Process**: 6-8 casts changed weekly, ending with Achilles tenotomy
-   **Post-casting**: Boot and bar used 23 hours daily for 3 months, then nightly until age 4
-   **Correction Order (CAVE)**:
    -   **C**avus (dorsiflexion of the first ray)
    -   **A**dductus (forefoot correction)
    -   **V**arus (hindfoot correction)
    -   **E**quinus (Achilles tenotomy)

### Soft Tissue Release

| Method         | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cincinnati** | Circumferential release of all structures             |
| **A la Carte** | Posteromedial release tailored to specific structures |

-   **Complications**: Scarring, stiffness, neurovascular risk, recurrence in resistant cases

## Surgical Options

| Technique | Use Case | Key Points |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Tendon Transfer** | Residual recurrence in ages 3-4 | Transfer TA to base of the 5th metatarsal |
| **Ilizarov Method** | Severe, stiff, older cases | Gradual correction with external fixation |
| **Osteotomy** | Recalcitrant deformities, older children | Calcaneus or lateral column shortening |
| **Talectomy** | Rare, primarily in cases of arthrogryposis |  |
| **Fusion** | Triple fusion in select cases to stabilize foot | Concerns for future ankle degeneration |

## Bony Features of Clubfoot

-   **Parallelism** of talus and calcaneus on both views
-   **Kite’s Angle** \< 20 degrees
-   **Turco’s Angle** 0 degrees in lateral dorsiflexion view
