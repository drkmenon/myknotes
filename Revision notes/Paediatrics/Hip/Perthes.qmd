## **Perthes Disease**

### Epidemiology

-   More common in boys than girls.
-   Typically affects children aged 4-8 years, with an age range of 2-15 years.
-   Predominantly affects White or Asian populations.
-   Often occurs in thin, small, skeletally immature children.
-   Bilateral involvement occurs in 10% of cases but is never concurrent.

### Aetiology

-   Idiopathic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the proximal femoral epiphysis.
-   Some children may have an underlying coagulopathy.
-   Theories include:
    1.  Repeated ischemic episodes.
    2.  Increased hydrostatic pressure due to venous congestion.
    3.  Association with fibrinolytic coagulopathy (currently favored theory).

### Clinical Presentation

-   Symptoms include a limp, hip or knee pain, and stiffness.

### Investigation

-   Blood tests if an abnormal condition is suspected.
-   Plain X-ray usually sufficient.
-   MRI can provide early diagnosis but does not impact management or outcome.

### Differential Diagnosis

**Unilateral** 1. Infection 2. Sickle cell infarct 3. Synovitis, inflammatory arthritis 4. Traumatic causes

**Bilateral** 1. Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia (SED) 2. Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED) 3. Gaucher’s Disease 4. Hypothyroidism

### Stages of Disease

1.  **Necrotic (Initial)** (6 months)
    -   AVN is evident but no collapse.
    -   Signs include the crescent sign (Caffey’s sign) and sclerosis.
2.  **Fragmentation (Resorption)** (6 months)
    -   Femoral head fragmentation, primarily of the lateral epiphysis.
    -   Damage occurs, and it is too late to alter the disease course.
3.  **Re-Ossification (Healing)** (18 months)
    -   Bone resorption and re-ossification of the femoral head.
4.  **Remodeling (Residual)** (3 years)
    -   Femoral head fully remodels, with residual Perthes deformities.

### Classification

**Herring’s Lateral Pillar Classification** - Considered the best prognostic indicator and offers good inter- and intra-observer reliability. Outcome worsens with increasing grade.

| Group   | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **A**   | Lateral pillar height is normal                  |
| **B**   | Lateral pillar height \>50%                      |
| **B/C** | Lateral pillar height 50% with a narrowed physis |
| **C**   | Lateral pillar height \<50%                      |

**Catteral Head-at-Risk Signs** - Associated with a worse prognosis: - **Gage Sign**: Triangular lucency on the lateral physis. - Horizontal orientation of physis. - **Lateral Subluxation** of the femoral head (most important). - Calcification lateral to the physis. - Metaphyseal cysts.

**Reimer’s Migration Index** - Indicates the degree of femoral head extrusion, useful for assessing when intervention is necessary.

### Problems with Classification

-   Best intervention time is before collapse and extrusion.
-   Existing classifications focus on the degree of collapse, making it too late to change the disease's natural course.
-   No classifications directly address femoral head extrusion, the most significant alterable factor surgically.

### Prognostic Factors

| Factor | Prognosis |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Age** | \<5 years: generally good prognosis with high remodeling potential |
| **Degree of Extrusion** | \>20% extrusion associated with poor prognosis |
| **Hip Stiffness** | Poor prognosis with stiff hips, regardless of treatment |
| **Gender** | Girls tend to have worse outcomes due to shorter remodeling time |

### Management

#### Head Deformation in Perthes & Containment Rationale

-   Head deformation, which occurs in the late fragmentation or early re-ossification phase, is the primary issue.
    -   Leads to coxa magna, trochanteric overgrowth, hip impingement, and early osteoarthritis.
    -   Deformation also causes premature physeal arrest and neck shortening, which results in Trendelenburg gait.

**Prevention Strategy**: Prevent lateral extrusion of the epiphysis through containment to avoid deformation.

#### Non-Operative Management

-   Focus on maintaining range of motion (ROM).
-   Avoid sports but allow weight-bearing.
-   Close follow-up to monitor for extrusion.
-   Approximately 60% of children manage without surgery.

#### Factors for Surgical Containment

-   **Age**: Low threshold for surgery in children \>8 years due to the likelihood of extrusion.
-   **Timing**: Containment is only effective in the initial or fragmentation stages.
-   **Hip Stiffness**: Poor outcomes with surgery if the hip is stiff; pre-operative traction may improve ROM.

**Femoral (VDRO) vs. Pelvic Osteotomy** - Femoral osteotomy is generally more effective and simpler. - Pelvic osteotomy is reserved for salvage procedures.

**Trochanteric Advancement or Epiphysiodesis** - Prevents trochanteric overgrowth and Trendelenburg gait. - Suitable for older children with limited femoral head remodeling potential.

### Management by Age

| Age Range | Management Strategy |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Under 5 years** | Observe if no extrusion; use abduction brace if extrusion is present |
| **5-8 years** | Watch if no extrusion; perform VDRO if extrusion is present |
| **\>8 years** | Aggressive treatment recommended due to poor prognosis |
| **Late Presentation with Deformity** | Options include trochanteric advancement, Chiari/shelf osteotomy, valgus osteotomy, cam excision, or hip fusion (convertible to THR later) |

### Long-Term Outcome

-   Few symptoms under 40 years of age, but most individuals over 40 years with Perthes disease develop symptoms.
