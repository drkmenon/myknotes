title: "Metatarsus adductus"
---

Metatarsus Adductus (MTA) is a common congenital foot deformity characterized by the inward curvature of the forefoot while the hindfoot remains in a neutral position. This condition usually resolves on its own but may require intervention in some cases.

## Epidemiology

-   **Incidence**: Occurs in approximately 12% of newborns.
-   **Natural Resolution**: 90% of cases resolve spontaneously by the age of 4.

## Aetiology

Metatarsus Adductus is primarily a **"packaging problem"** due to limited intrauterine space, which causes the forefoot to turn inward. It is often associated with **Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)**, making early screening essential.

## Classification

Metatarsus Adductus is commonly classified using the **Bleck Classification**, which considers:

1\. **Heel Bisector Line**: Determines the severity based on the position of the forefoot relative to the heel.

2\. **Deformity Stiffness**: Assesses the flexibility of the foot to guide treatment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Diagnosis

1.  **Clinical Examination**:
    -   Observe forefoot adduction with a neutral hindfoot.
    -   Screen for other foot deformities and any associated conditions, such as DDH.
2.  **Tickle Foot Test**:
    -   Gentle stimulation of the lateral foot triggers peroneal muscle activity, indicating flexibility.
3.  **Heel Bisector Angle**:
    -   An abnormal heel bisector angle confirms the diagnosis.

## Management

Treatment of Metatarsus Adductus varies based on the age of the child and the stiffness of the deformity.
