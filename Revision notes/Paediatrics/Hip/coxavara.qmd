title: "Coxa Vara"
---

**Definition**\
Coxa Vara is defined as a neck-shaft angle of less than 120 degrees.

### Epidemiology

| Factor              | Details                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Incidence           | 1 in 25,000 live births |
| Gender              | Boys = Girls            |
| Laterality          | Left = Right            |
| Racial Predilection | None                    |
| Bilateral Cases     | 30%                     |

### Aetiology

The primary cause is an ossification defect in the infero-medial proximal femoral physis, specifically within Fairbank’s triangle. It is associated with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance.

### Types of Coxa Vara

| Type | Characteristics |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Developmental | Due to primary ossification defect; physis becomes more vertical over time, increasing shear force and leading to physeal separation. |
| Congenital | Associated with conditions like Congenital Short Femur (CSF), Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency (PFFD), fibular hemimelia, etc. |
| Acquired | Occurs secondary to conditions like Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis (SUFE), Perthes Disease, or Skeletal Dysplasia. |

### Clinical Presentation

-   **Typical Onset:** Once a child starts walking, usually before the age of 5.
-   **Symptoms:**
    -   Trendelenburg gait
    -   Waddling gait or limp (if bilateral)
    -   Usually painless
    -   Prominent trochanter

### Imaging Features

-   **Inverted Y Sign:** A pathognomonic feature caused by fragmentation of the infero-medial physis.
-   **Other Imaging Observations:**
    -   Delayed ossification (may resemble Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)).
    -   Infero-medial quadrant placement of metaphysis.
    -   Physeal arrest.
    -   Trochanteric overgrowth.

### Management

The treatment approach for coxa vara depends on **Hilgenreiner’s Epiphyseal Angle (HEA)**, which is the angle between the physis and Hilgenreiner’s line.

| HEA Angle     | Management Strategy                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| \< 45 degrees | Non-operative; often corrects spontaneously |
| 45-60 degrees | Close observation with serial X-rays        |
| \> 60 degrees | Surgical intervention with osteotomy        |

#### Surgical Approach: Pawels Y-Shaped Osteotomy

-   **Purpose:** Corrects HEA to approximately 16 degrees to reduce shear force on the physis.
-   **Procedure:**
    -   Calculate osteotomy closing wedge angle as HEA minus 16 degrees.
    -   Use K-wires to align cuts and saw to perform osteotomy.
    -   Fixation is achieved with a Tension Band Wire (TBW), blade plate, or locking plate.
-   **Trochanteric Advancement:** Considered if Trendelenburg gait is present.

### Complications

-   **Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** Especially common in intracapsular osteotomy.
-   **Physeal Arrest:** Occurs in about 80% of cases.
-   **Trochanteric Overgrowth:** May lead to hip issues.
-   **Recurrence of Coxa Vara:** Noted in approximately 50% of cases after treatment.
