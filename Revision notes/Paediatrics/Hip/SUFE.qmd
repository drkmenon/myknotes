## **Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis (SUFE)**

### Epidemiology

-   Predominantly affects boys more than girls (60:40 ratio) due to delayed physeal closure caused by testosterone.
-   Observed racial variation with higher incidence in Polynesians and Black populations.
-   Mean age of onset: 12 years for girls, 13 years for boys, typically within a range of 6-15 years.
-   Strong association with obesity, with most affected individuals above the 95th percentile for weight.
-   Occurs more frequently on the left side than the right.
-   Approximately 80% of cases are unilateral, with 20% bilateral; however, 20% of unilateral cases may progress to bilateral involvement.

### Aetiology

-   Characterized by anterior displacement of the femoral neck on the femoral head, occurring through the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate.
-   Caused by mechanical forces acting on a susceptible growth plate, increasing physeal shear stress.

**Mechanical Factors** - Obesity - Femoral retroversion - Vertically oriented physis - Enlarged hypertrophic zone

**Chemical Factors** - Endocrinopathy is likely present to some degree, influencing growth plate susceptibility: - Growth hormone: Increases hypertrophic zone size - Hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypogonadism, renal failure, and prior radiotherapy

### Classification

**Stability** - **Stable**: Weight-bearing possible - **Unstable**: Unable to bear weight; unstable cases have a 50% risk of avascular necrosis (AVN)

**Chronicity** - Acute (\<3 weeks) - Acute on chronic - Chronic (\>3 weeks), typically after physeal closure

**Severity** (based on Southwick angle) - **Mild**: \<30 degrees - **Moderate**: 30-50 degrees - **Severe**: \>50 degrees

### XR Features

-   Epiphysis is displaced posteriorly and inferiorly with the femoral shaft in varus alignment.
-   Early indicators include a widened, hazy physis, while other classic signs include:
    -   **KLEIN’s Line (AP view)**: Trethowan’s sign
    -   **STEEL’s Blanch sign**: Overlap of epiphysis and metaphysis on AP view
    -   Widened inferior joint space
    -   Apparent size reduction of epiphysis, due to it being situated behind the neck
    -   Remodeling, sclerosis, and inferior callus observed in chronic cases

### Management Goals

-   Prevent progression of the slip and avoid complications associated with SUFE and its treatments.

**Initial Treatment** - Non-weight bearing until surgery is performed. - Endocrine screen (U&E, TFT, GH) if: - Young age, valgus SUFE, thin body habitus, relevant medical history, or bilateral involvement is noted.

#### Stable SUFE

-   Generally, 96% have a favorable outcome with in situ pinning, regardless of severity. Deformity may be corrected later if necessary with osteotomy.
-   Avoiding reduction reduces AVN risk significantly.
-   Preferred method: Single, partially or fully threaded cannulated screw. A single screw is almost as effective as two screws and reduces complications. Aim for the screw to pass perpendicularly across the physis, centering within the femoral head, without penetrating it.

#### Unstable SUFE

-   High risk of AVN (\~50%) and poor outcome in half of cases.
-   Urgent fixation is recommended, ideally within 24 hours.
-   In situ pinning is the preferred approach, though gentle reduction and decompression may be recommended (no consensus).

#### Prophylactic Pinning

-   Consider for at-risk patients:
    -   Younger than 10 years old
    -   Endocrinopathy
    -   Unstable SUFE
-   PSA above 14 degrees may also indicate a need for prophylactic pinning.

### Osteotomy

-   Recommended after skeletal maturity, primarily for symptomatic cases to reduce impingement and enhance range of motion.
    -   Intertrochanteric osteotomy preferred due to a lower AVN risk; intracapsular osteotomy is technically easier.
-   Not advisable acutely due to high risks.

### Complications

1.  **Chondrolysis**: Risk increases with screw/wire penetration.
2.  **Fracture**: Increased risk with multiple wire passes or low screw entry.
3.  **AVN**: Associated with aggressive reduction and unstable SUFE.

#### Morbidity from SUFE Deformity

1.  CAM impingement
2.  Early-onset osteoarthritis (OA)

### Aftercare

-   Partial weight-bearing for 6–12 weeks, continuing until physeal arrest.
-   Follow-up until skeletal maturity to monitor for contralateral SUFE.
-   AVN occurrence risk reduces significantly after 1 year.
