**Skewfoot**, also known as **serpentine foot** or **Z-foot**, is a complex congenital foot deformity that combines features of **forefoot adduction** and **hindfoot valgus**. It is sometimes considered a combination of *metatarsus adductus* (curving inward of the forefoot) and *hindfoot valgus* (outward angulation of the heel).

## Aetiology

-   **Condition Type**: Uncommon, complex
-   **Deformity**: Forefoot adduction and hindfoot valgus
-   **Cause**: Considered a packaging disorder

### Key Characteristics:

-   **Forefoot Adduction**: The front part of the foot curves inward.
-   **Hindfoot Valgus**: The heel is angled outward, which causes the arch of the foot to flatten.
-   **Midfoot Abduction**: Often, the middle part of the foot appears to bend outward to compensate for the positioning of the forefoot and hindfoot.

### Symptoms:

-   **Foot pain** when weight-bearing, especially in more severe cases.
-   **Difficulty finding comfortable footwear** due to the foot’s shape.
-   **Visible foot deformity**, where the foot may appear Z-shaped or serpentine in alignment.

### Prognosis:

With treatment, the goal is to realign the foot to improve function and reduce pain. However, because it’s a complex deformity, treatment outcomes vary, and follow-up care is often necessary.

## Management

### Observation

-   Most cases are **asymptomatic** and can be observed.

### Surgical Treatment

-   **Non-operative** treatment is generally **unsuccessful** for symptomatic cases.
-   Surgical approach involves a **combination of osteotomies**:
    -   **Medial sliding calcaneal osteotomy**: Corrects hindfoot valgus
    -   **Lateral shortening or medial column lengthening osteotomy**: Addresses forefoot adduction
