## Congenital Oblique Talus

-   **Talonavicular Subluxation**: The talus and navicular are misaligned.
-   **Key Feature**: This condition can be corrected by passive plantarflexion, which helps to differentiate it from **Congenital Vertical Talus (CVT)**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Congenital Vertical Talus (CVT)

### Aetiology

-   **Congenital Irreducible Dorsal Dislocation of the Navicular**
-   **Vertical Talus Orientation**
-   **Severe Soft Tissue Contractures**
-   Occurs in **50% bilateral cases**
-   **50% associated with other congenital issues**: Conditions like arthrogryposis, neuromuscular diseases, and myelodysplasia.

### Clinical Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Disability** | Causes significant disability due to rigid foot structure. |
| **Rigid Convex Sole** | The sole has a rounded, convex shape. |
| **Valgus Hindfoot** | Outward angulation of the heel. |
| **Rocker Bottom Foot** | The foot resembles a "Persian slipper" or rocker bottom. |
| **Peg Leg Gait** | Stiff foot limits push-off, resulting in a peg leg gait. |

### Imaging

-   **Lateral X-Ray** in forced plantarflexion is diagnostic.
-   **Key Findings**:
    -   Navicular is dorsally dislocated.
    -   Talus is not parallel to the calcaneus.
    -   **Talo-Calcaneal Angle**: Increased to \>40° (normal: 0-20°).
    -   **Meary’s Angle**: Increased to \>20° (normal: 0-10°).

### Management

-   **Non-surgical management is ineffective.**
-   **Surgical Options**:
    -   **Open Reduction** of talus and extensive soft tissue release, though may fail.
    -   **Talectomy** as a last resort.
    -   **Triple Fusion** as an alternative.
