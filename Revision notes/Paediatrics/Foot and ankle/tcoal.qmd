title: "Tarsal Coalition"
---

## Aetiology

-   **Prevalence**: Found in \~1% of the population, potentially more.
-   **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant.
-   **Pathogenesis**: Failure of mesenchymal differentiation in peritalar joints.
    -   Results in a **fibro-osseus bar** instead of a joint.
    -   **20%** have multiple coalitions in the same foot.
    -   **50%** are bilateral.

### Associations

-   **Multiple Coalitions**: Linked to Apert’s syndrome and fibula hemimelia.

## Pathoanatomy

-   **Common Locations**:
    -   **Calcaneonavicular**: Most common site.
    -   **Talocalcaneal**: Second most common, often in the medial facet.
    -   **Other Coalitions**: Rare, can occur between any peritalar joints.

## Clinical Presentation

-   Symptoms typically appear once the coalition ossifies and becomes painful.
    -   **Calcaneonavicular** coalitions present earlier than **talocalcaneal** (age 8-15 years).
    -   **Symptoms**: Recurrent ankle sprains, difficulty on uneven terrain.

### Examination

| Feature                         | Description                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Rigid Planovalgus Deformity** | Fixed flatfoot with heel valgus |
| **Sinus Tarsi Pain**            | Pain due to impingement         |

## Classification

-   **By Anatomy of Coalition**:
    -   Based on location and involved joints.
-   **By Nature of Bar**:
    -   **Fibrous**, **Cartilaginous**, or **Osseous** bar types.

## Imaging

-   **X-Ray Findings**:
    -   **Negative Meary’s Angle**: Indicates planovalgus deformity.
    -   **Anteater Sign**: Suggestive of calcaneonavicular coalition.
    -   **C-Sign**: Seen in talocalcaneal coalitions; forms a “C” shape between talus and calcaneus.
    -   **Dorsal Talar Beaking**: Non-specific finding, common with coalition.
-   **Advanced Imaging**:
    -   **CT Scan**: Gold standard for evaluating osseous coalitions.
    -   **MRI**: Confirms fibrous or cartilaginous coalitions.

## Management

### Non-Operative

-   **Indications**: Early presentation with flexible deformity.
-   **Treatment**: Activity modification and orthotic support.

### Surgical Intervention

-   **Indications**: Failed non-operative management, arthritis, rigid deformity.
    -   **Resection**: Preferred for calcaneonavicular and \<50% talocalcaneal coalitions.
        -   **Advantages**: Preserves motion but may have recurrence.
    -   **Fusion**: Recommended if \>50% of the medial facet is involved.
        -   **Types**: Subtalar fusion preferred; may require triple fusion in severe cases.
        -   **Indications**: Late presentation with osteoarthritis.
    -   **Additional Procedures**: Corrective osteotomies for fixed valgus deformity.
