## Kohler’s Disease {#kohlers-disease}

-   **Gender Prevalence**: Boys \> Girls
-   **Cause**: Idiopathic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the navicular bone.
-   **Development**: Navicular is the last bone to ossify in the foot.
-   **Symptoms**: Pain, limping, weight-bearing on the lateral border of the foot.
-   **Natural History**: Navicular reconstitutes naturally within 18 months; symptoms improve before that.
-   **Treatment**: Short period of restricted weight-bearing with a plaster cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Curly Toes {#curly-toes}

-   **Cause**: Contracture of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) or flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), usually affecting the lateral three toes.
-   **Treatment**: Tenotomy of FDL around age 3 if symptomatic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Polydactyly {#polydactyly}

-   **Description**: Presence of extra toes, commonly on the lateral (post-axial) side.
-   **Family History**: Often positive.
-   **Associated Conditions**: Linked with congenital hallux varus.
-   **Treatment**: Typically, the most lateral toe is removed, considering both bony and soft tissue components. Optimal age for surgery is around 9-12 months.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Congenital Hallux Varus {#congenital-hallux-varus}

-   **Associated Conditions**: Linked with polydactyly.
-   **Anatomy**: Short, thick first metatarsal (MT); adductor hallucis longus is the deforming muscle.
-   **Treatment**: Rarely requires surgery; if indicated, involves release of adductor hallucis longus and possibly osteotomy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overlapping Toe {#overlapping-toe}

-   **Description**: Usually affects the 5th toe overlapping the 4th toe.
-   **Symptoms**: May cause issues with footwear.
-   **Treatment Options**:
    -   Stretching (often successful).
    -   Syndactylization of the 5th and 4th toes.
    -   Tenotomy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Accessory Navicular {#accessory-navicular}

-   **Prevalence**: Present in about 12% of the population.
-   **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic but associated with flatfoot.
-   **Natural History**: Tends to fuse with growth.
-   **Treatment**: If symptomatic, excision is effective, usually confirmed with a diagnostic injection first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Habitual Toe Walking {#habitual-toe-walking}

-   **Cause**: Often due to tight Achilles tendon.
-   **Natural History**: Usually resolves spontaneously.
-   **Treatment**: May require serial casting or Achilles lengthening if persistent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ball and Socket Ankle {#ball-and-socket-ankle}

-   **Description**: A compensatory mechanism to increase ankle movement, often associated with other rigidity issues.
-   **Associations**:
    -   Tarsal coalition (50% of cases).
    -   Absence of lateral rays (50%).
-   **Etiology**: Generally congenital, sometimes part of conditions like fibula hemimelia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Juvenile Bunions {#juvenile-bunions}

-   **Gender Prevalence**: Girls \> Boys.
-   **Management**: Avoid surgery where possible to prevent recurrence due to growth; accommodative shoe wear is recommended.
-   **Surgical Consideration**: Ensure the first ray is not hypermobile if surgery is considered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Iselin’s Disease {#iselins-disease}

-   **Description**: Traction apophysitis of the 5th metatarsal (MT) base.
-   **Management**: Non-operative treatment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sever’s Disease {#severs-disease}

-   **Description**: Traction apophysitis of the calcaneal apophysis.
-   **Age Range**: Typically affects children aged 7-15 years.
-   **Management**: Non-operative treatment. \`\`\`
