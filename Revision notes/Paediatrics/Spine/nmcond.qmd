## Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita

### Aetiology

-   Non-progressive disorder
-   Lack of anterior horn cells
-   Myopathic, neuropathic, or mixed

### Diagnosis

-   Confirmed by:
    -   Enzyme tests
    -   Nerve conduction studies (NCS)
    -   Muscle biopsy at 3 months

### Features

-   Multiple joint contractures – joints lack skin creases
-   Normal facies
-   Normal intelligence
-   No visceral involvement

### Affected Body Areas

-   **Upper Limbs**:
    -   Shoulder internal rotation and adduction
    -   Elbow extension contractures
    -   Management:
        -   Leave one arm extended
        -   Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) & serial casting
        -   Release and supracondylar osteotomy
        -   One arm for feeding, other for self-care
-   **Hips**:
    -   Teratologic dislocations
    -   Open reduction +/- femoral shortening or VDRO
-   **Knees**:
    -   Early release of hamstrings
-   **Feet**:
    -   Congenital vertical talus and rigid club foot
    -   Will not respond to casting
    -   Open release; if unsuccessful – talectomy
    -   Aim for a plantigrade, shoeable foot
-   **Spine**:
    -   C-shaped large curve scoliosis
    -   May need fusion to pelvis if progressing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Distal Arthrogryposis Syndrome

-   Autosomal dominant
-   Similar features to Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita
-   Hands and feet more affected than proximal joints

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Larsen’s Syndrome

-   Similar to Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita but contractures are milder
-   Features:
    -   Multiple dislocated joints
    -   Cervical spine kyphosis:
        -   May progress and cause myelopathy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Multiple Pterygium Syndrome

-   Joint contractures with webbing on the flexor aspect
-   Surgical caution:
    -   Neurovascular bundle close during release of webs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Friedrich’s Ataxia

### Characteristics

-   Most common spinocerebellar disorder
-   Autosomal recessive
-   Lack of Frataxin protein
-   Affects mitochondria
-   Onset: 10–15 years
-   Death: By 50 years (cardiomyopathy)

### Clinical Features & Management

-   Staggering, wide-based ataxic gait
-   Increased polyphasic waveforms on NCS
-   Cardiomyopathy
-   Cavovarus/Equinovarus – stiff:
    -   Require fusions
-   Scoliosis:
    -   Needs fusion due to aggressive progression (not always down to pelvis)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)

### Characteristics

-   Most common genetic disease causing pediatric death
-   1 in 10,000 live births
-   Loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord
-   Autosomal recessive

### Classification

-   **SMA1**:
    -   Onset \<6 months
    -   Death by 2 years (respiratory failure)
-   **SMA2**:
    -   Onset \<24 months
    -   Life expectancy: 15–20 years
-   **SMA3**:
    -   Onset \>24 months
    -   Normal life expectancy
    -   Independently stands

### Clinical Features & Management

-   Weakness develops from proximal to distal
-   **Hip Dislocations**:
    -   Usually asymptomatic; non-operative treatment
-   **Scoliosis**:
    -   Severe, progressive
    -   Large curves causing respiratory compromise
    -   Aggressive treatment with long fusions
    -   May reduce walking capability
-   **Feet**:
    -   Equinovarus common
    -   Aim for pain-free, plantigrade, shoeable foot
    -   Use tenotomy & osteotomy rather than transfer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Polio

-   Viral infection causing loss of anterior horn cells in spine and brainstem
-   Features:
    -   Often unilateral
    -   No sensory deficit
    -   Weakness and smaller limb typical
-   No new cases since vaccination, but sequelae still treated

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathies

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT)

#### Aetiology

-   Autosomal dominant disorder causing predominantly distal motor and sensory deficits
-   Family history often positive

#### Types

1.  **HSMN 1** (CMT – Myelopathic/Hypertrophic):
    -   More common
    -   Onset: 10–20 years
    -   Demyelination of nerves
    -   Nerve conduction studies: Prolonged latencies, reduced velocities
    -   Absent reflexes
2.  **HSMN 2** (CMT – Neuropathic):
    -   Less common
    -   Onset: 20–30 years
    -   Wallerian degeneration without demyelination
    -   EMGs: Near normal
    -   Present reflexes
3.  **HSMN 3** (Dejerine-Sottas Disease):
    -   Autosomal recessive
    -   Onset: Infancy
    -   More severe manifestations:
        -   Foot drop
        -   Scoliosis
        -   Difficulty ambulating

#### Clinical Features of All Types

-   Motor \> sensory affliction
-   Most affected muscles: Peronei and Tibialis Anterior
-   Predominantly foot symptoms:
    -   Cavus, Cavovarus, hammer toes
-   **Management**:
    -   Surgery aims to maintain flexibility with transfers/osteotomy
    -   Avoid fusion where possible – young patients
-   Rare Features:
    -   Hip dislocation
    -   Scoliosis
    -   Intrinsic wasting of hands

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guillain-Barre Syndrome

-   Idiopathic post-viral polyneuropathy
-   Features:
    -   Symmetric ascending motor neuropathy
    -   Self-limiting
    -   Death by respiratory failure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hemihypertrophy

-   Unilateral limb hypertrophy
-   Idiopathic cause
-   Associated with:
    -   Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
    -   Renal abnormalities (e.g., Wilm’s tumor)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome

-   Hemihypertrophy with associated hemangiomas and AV malformations
-   Management:
    -   Amputation or embolization often necessary

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Proteus Syndrome

-   Overgrowth of hands and feet with spinal deformity
-   Bizarre facial features
-   Must differentiate from NF1 and McCune-Albright Syndrome
