title: "Congenital Kyphosis"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types (as with scoliosis):

1.  **Failure of Formation** (Type 1)
2.  **Failure of Segmentation** (Type 2)
3.  **Mixed**

### Failure of Formation (Type 1)

-   Has the highest rate of progression and neurologic injury of any spinal deformity.
-   Causes **acute kyphosis**.
-   **High association** (\>50%) with **neural anomaly**.

### Management

#### Non-Operative:

-   **Type 2 curves** can be observed with monitoring.

#### Operative Indications:

-   **Neurologic deficit**.
-   **\>50-degree curve** in children under **5 years** with a **Type 1 curve**.
-   **Progression of any other type curve**.

#### Surgical Procedure:

-   **Posterior instrumented fusion**.
    -   Essentially a **posterior hemiepiphysiodesis**.
-   Add **anterior decompression** if there is a **neurologic deficit**.
