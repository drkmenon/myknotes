### Classification:

1.  **Non-Dystrophic** â€“ similar to **Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)**.
2.  **Dystrophic**:
    -   **Vertebral scalloping**.
    -   **Tight acute curves**.
    -   **Foraminal widening**.
    -   **Pencil-like transverse processes (TPs)**.

### Features:

-   **Kyphoscoliosis** due to **NF**.
-   **High rate of intraneural anomalies**.
-   **MRI** is essential before any intervention.

### Management:

-   **Management principles** are similar to those of **AIS**.
