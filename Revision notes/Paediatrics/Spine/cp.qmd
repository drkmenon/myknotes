## Cerebral Palsy

### Definition
Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a non-progressive brain injury causing neuromuscular imbalance and upper motor neuron disease, typically presenting before the age of 2.

---

### Risk Factors
- Prematurity
- Anoxic birth trauma
- TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes)
- Other third-trimester disturbances or intrauterine issues

---

### Classification

| Type       | Characteristics |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Spastic**   | Muscle imbalance and contractures, eventually causing bone deformity and arthrosis. Most common and treatable surgically. |
| **Athetoid**  | Dystonia and involuntary movements. |
| **Ataxic**    | Predominantly cerebellar symptoms. |

| Geography   | Characteristics |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Quadriplegia** | All limbs involved, low IQ, severe spasticity, unable to walk. |
| **Diplegia**     | Primarily lower limbs, possible normal intelligence, most able to walk. |
| **Hemiparesis**  | Unilateral involvement, most eventually able to walk. |

### GMFCS - Gross Motor Function Classification System

| Level       | Functional Description |
|-------------|------------------------|
| GMFCS 1     | Walks, jumps, runs, climbs; minor balance/speed issues. |
| GMFCS 2     | Walks with stair rail support; difficulty on uneven surfaces. |
| GMFCS 3     | Walks with aid; self-propels wheelchair. |
| GMFCS 4     | Occasional frame walking; primarily wheelchair-dependent. |
| GMFCS 5     | Cannot support head independently; requires wheelchair assistance. |

### Future Functional Estimation
Poor prognostic indicators include:
- Retention of two or more primitive reflexes at 1 year (e.g., Moro and Parachute reflexes).
- Inability to sit by 5 years or walk by 8 years.

---

### Treatment Principles
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Includes PT and OT.
- **Surgery**: Generally deferred until after age 3, aiming to restore function and relieve pain.
- **Treatment Ladder**:
  - **MDT**: Physio, OT for ADL support, speech therapy.
  - **Splinting/Serial Casting** and **Bracing**.
  - **Medications**:
    - **Baclofen**: GABA receptor agonist for muscle relaxation.
    - **Botulinum Toxin (Botox)**: Temporary muscle relaxation.

| Surgery Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Dorsal Rhizotomy** | Cutting of dorsal rootlets (L1-S1) to reduce spasticity. |
| **Soft Tissue Releases** | Includes tendon transfers, osteotomy, and fusion for structural corrections. |

### Treatment of Commonly Affected Areas

#### Spine
- **Deformity**: Primarily scoliosis, sometimes kyphosis.
- **Management**: Posterior and long fusion including pelvis, anterior fusion if needed.

#### Hips
- **Hip Subluxation/Dislocation**: Common in non-ambulatory, GMFCS level 5 children.
- **Management**: Includes adductor tenotomy, iliopsoas release, VDRO, or Dega osteotomy based on age and migration percentage.

#### Feet
- **Planovalgus/Equinovalgus Foot**: Common in spastic diplegia, treated with calcaneal lengthening osteotomy and peroneus brevis lengthening.
- **Equinovarus Foot**: Common in spastic hemiparesis, managed with SPLAT transfer, TA/TP transfer, and Achilles lengthening if needed.

#### Knee
- **Crouch Gait**: Often due to hamstring contractures, managed through gait analysis, bracing, and hamstring release if necessary.

#### Upper Limb
- **Shoulder Adduction/Internal Rotation**: Often requires Botox or release if affecting ADLs.
- **Hand and Wrist Deformities**: Managed with OT, physio, tendon transfers, or fusion where needed.

### Prognostic Indicators and Surgical Outcomes
Outcomes depend on flexibility, patient aims, pain, and severity of joint or skeletal arthrosis. Non-surgical management includes splints and orthoses, while surgical interventions aim to correct structural deformities to maximize function and comfort.
