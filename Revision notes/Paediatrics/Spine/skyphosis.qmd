title: "Scheuermann’s Kyphosis"
---

### Epidemiology

-   **Incidence**: 1-8% of the population.
-   **Gender ratio**: Males 7:1, Females.

### Definition

-   **Kyphosis**: Thoracic kyphosis \> 45° with more than 5° of anterior wedging in 3 consecutive vertebrae.

### Aetiology

-   **Developmental error** of collagen leading to disturbed endochondral ossification of the vertebral end plates, resulting in wedge-shaped vertebrae and kyphotic deformity.
-   **Commonly affects the thoracic spine**, though it may also involve the lumbar region.
-   **Thoracolumbar junction** is usually spared.
-   **Lumbar Scheuermann’s**: Similar features but no vertebral wedging, more likely to be symptomatic.

### Clinical Presentation

-   **Age group**: Typically affects adolescent boys.
-   **Symptoms**:
    -   Poor posture.
    -   Pain over the deformity.
    -   Rare neurologic compromise.
    -   Kyphosis does not correct with hyperextension.

### Imaging Features

-   **Wedge-shaped vertebrae**.
-   **Irregular end plates**.
-   **Kyphosis with gibbus**: Acute angular kyphosis.
-   **Schmorl’s nodes**: Protrusion of cartilage from the disc through the end plate into the vertebra.

### Management

#### Non-Operative:

-   **Bracing**: Recommended if near skeletal maturity and pain is not a major issue.

#### Operative:

-   **Indications for surgery**:
    -   **Kyphosis \>75°**.
    -   Progressive kyphosis in younger children.
    -   Significant back pain.
    -   Neurologic deficit (rare).
    -   Cosmesis: Relative indication for surgery.
-   **Surgical Procedure**:
    -   **Posterior Instrumented Fusion**.
    -   **Multiple wedge osteotomies** (Smith-Peterson) may be needed.
    -   **Anterior release** only required if curve \>90°.
    -   **Decompression** of neurologic structures if deficit is present (rare).

### Complications

-   **Junctional Kyphosis**.
-   **Neurologic injury**: Uncommon, but requires attention during surgery.
