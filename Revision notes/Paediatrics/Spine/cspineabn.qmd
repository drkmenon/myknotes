### Introduction

#### Embryology

-   Vertebrae develop from sclerotomes, derived from somites and from the notochord.
-   The dermatomyotome forms spinal musculature and skin.
-   Organogenesis occurs concurrently with spine development, leading to multisystem abnormalities.

| Structure                  | Ossification Centers                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Atlas                      | 3 (lateral masses and body)                  |
| Axis                       | 5 primary (H shape on X-ray) and 2 secondary |
| Dens                       | Appears at age 3 and fuses at age 12         |
| Dentocentral Synchondrosis | Fuses by age 7                               |

### Atlanto-Occipital Stability

-   Stability provided by facet congruity, capsular ligaments, and the tectorial membrane, extending from the posterior longitudinal ligament to the foramen magnum.

### Atlanto-Axial Stability

-   **Static Stability**: Odontoid peg and transverse ligament.
-   **Secondary Stabilisers**: Alar ligaments and apical ligament.

### Atlantoaxial Instability

-   AP or rotatory instability due to conditions such as Down’s syndrome, Morquio’s syndrome (hypoplastic odontoid), or Grisel’s Disease.
-   **Imaging**: Atlantoaxial AP instability if ADI \>5 mm; Powers ratio \<1; SAC ≥13 mm (similar to PADI); Rule of 3rds at the odontoid level.

### Basilar Invagination

-   Defined by proximal migration of the odontoid through the foramen magnum.
-   Common in Klippel-Feil syndrome, Morquio, Down syndrome, achondroplasia.
-   **Imaging**: Present if PEG is above McRae’s line or \>5 mm above McGregor’s line.
-   **Management**: Surgical intervention to prevent or stabilize neurologic symptoms.

### Klippel-Feil Syndrome

-   Failure of cervical spine segmentation.
-   **Classic Features** (in \<50%): Stiff neck, low hairline, webbed neck.
-   **Associations**: Congenital scoliosis, Sprengel’s shoulder, renal and cardiac anomalies.
-   **Management**: Supportive; myelopathy may require decompression and stabilization.

### Os Odontoidum

-   Occurs when odontoid ossification centers fail to coalesce by 12 years, appearing similar to a type-2 peg fracture.
-   **Symptoms**: Neurologic issues with ADI \>4 mm; SAC \<13 mm.
-   **Treatment**: C1-3 fusion.

### Intervertebral Disc Calcification

-   Self-limiting condition with calcified C-spine discs, low-grade fever, neck pain, increased ESR, and decreased ROM.

### Down’s Syndrome

-   Trisomy 21, commonly associated with atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital instability.
-   Most children are asymptomatic; treat symptomatically or if severe instability is present.

### Morquio’s Syndrome

-   Mucopolysaccharidosis with 100% incidence of atlantoaxial instability due to odontoid hypoplasia.
-   Low threshold for stabilization due to high incidence of cord injury.

### Torticollis

-   Defined by head tilt with chin rotation.
-   **Causes**:
    -   Acute torticollis (self-limiting).
    -   Congenital anomalies (from birth, painless).
    -   Ocular, neurogenic, psychologic, and muscular torticollis.
-   **Management**: Physiotherapy for young children; surgical release for older children if necessary.

| Cause of Torticollis | Description | Management |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Acute Torticollis | No SCM contracture, muscle spasm | Self-limiting |
| Congenital Anomalies | Webbed neck, low hairline | No treatment needed |
| Muscular Torticollis | SCM contracture | Physiotherapy, SCM release if needed |

### Larsen’s Syndrome

-   Characterized by congenital dislocations (e.g., radial head, knees, hips) and rapidly progressive kyphosis of the cervical spine.
-   **Management**: Responds well to cervical spine PIS.
