### **Physeal Injuries and Bar Formation**

### **Aetiology of Bridging**

-   **Definition**: Bridging occurs when there is any direct contact or communication between the metaphysis and epiphysis, often resulting in ossification and bar formation.

#### **Most Common Causes**

1.  **Trauma**
    -   High-energy injuries.
    -   Displaced fractures, especially Types 3, 4, and 5.
    -   Axial compression injuries.
2.  **Surgery**
    -   **Pin placement**: Thin, smooth, perpendicular pins are safest. Risks increase with threaded, large, oblique pins or multiple passes.
    -   **Interference with perichondrial ring**: This ring stabilizes the physis, and disruption can destabilize it.
    -   **Physeal violation with implants** (e.g., nails for femur fractures).
3.  **Specific Physes Susceptibility**
    -   Distal femur is highly susceptible due to its wavy structure, which increases surface area, allowing fractures to cross multiple physeal parts.

#### **Non-Fracture Causes**

-   **Irradiation**
-   **Tumors**
-   **Infections**
-   **Congenital disorders** (e.g., Madelung’s deformity, Blount’s disease)

### **Pathophysiology of Physeal Injury & Growth Arrest**

| Physis Zones | Characteristics |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Hypertrophic Zone** | Avascular, poor healing potential, mostly cellular with minimal matrix |
| **Osseo-Cartilaginous Junction** | Metaphysis and physis are supported by the perichondrial ring of LaCroix; damage here disrupts the physis |

-   **Growth Arrest**: Occurs in about 10% of physeal fractures, more common in Type 4 and 5 fractures.
-   **Adolescents**: Higher likelihood of arrest due to the thickness of the physis and weaker cartilage, though with minimal remaining growth potential, impact is less significant.

#### **Bar Formation**

-   Begins around 6 weeks post-injury but may not be clinically evident for some time.
-   Requires follow-up until skeletal maturity, especially in:
    -   Types 4 and 5 fractures.
    -   High-risk and lower limb physes due to potential impacts on leg length and mechanical alignment.
-   **Bridging threshold**: Damage needs to exceed 7% of physis cross-section for bridging to occur.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Classification of Physeal Bars**

| Classification | Description |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Position** | Central, Linear, Peripheral |
| **Size** | Critical size is 50% of physeal area, which is the upper limit for resection; measured on axial CT or MRI for precision. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **X-Ray Evaluation**

-   **Signs**:
    -   **Angular deformity**.
    -   **Visible bar**.
    -   **Asymmetry in Harris growth recovery lines**:
        -   These sclerotic lines indicate calcification post-physeal injury.
        -   Growth lines should ideally be parallel to the physis; convergence towards a bar suggests arrest.
        -   The gap between growth lines and the physis shows growth since the injury. Complete arrest shows no growth lines.
-   **Imaging**:
    -   **CT scan**: Offers better definition of bony structures.
    -   **MRI scan**: Ideal for identifying fibrous bars.

### **Factors Affecting Bridge Resection**

| Factor | Impact on Treatment |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Aetiology** | Trauma-related bars have better outcomes than those from infections. |
| **Physeal Location & Growth Contribution** | Higher growth potential enhances remodeling. |
| **Age & Growth Potential** | Younger children benefit more from resection; growth charts help assess potential. |
| **Bar Size** | Optimal outcomes with bars \<25%; resectable up to 50%. |
| **Bar Location** | \- **Peripheral**: Causes angular deformity; resection recommended. <br> - **Central**: Harder to resect, causes limb length discrepancy if large. |

**Resection Criteria**: 1. Child has at least **2 years** or **2 cm** of remaining growth. 2. **Bar size \<25%**, ideally, but maximum resection up to **50%**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Alternative Treatments to Bar Resection**

1.  **Epiphysiodesis**
    -   Prevents angular deformity in older children.
    -   May include contralateral epiphysiodesis for symmetry.
2.  **Osteotomy**
    -   Corrects angulation; can be combined with bar resection or delayed to observe bar resection’s effect on angulation.
3.  **Limb Lengthening**
    -   Conducted at skeletal maturity.
    -   Option if bar is irresectable, too large, or resection fails.
4.  **Delayed Hemiepiphysiodesis**
    -   Performed opposite the bar to correct angulation once resected area shows growth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Resection Technique**

-   **Approach**: Based on bar type and location.
    -   Central bars often need access through osteotomy or a metaphyseal window.
    -   Use curettes or burrs for bar resection, with continuous irrigation.
-   **Interposition Grafts**: Fill space with a fat or PMMA graft; both materials show equivalent results.
-   **Corrective Osteotomy**: For irreparable angular deformities.
