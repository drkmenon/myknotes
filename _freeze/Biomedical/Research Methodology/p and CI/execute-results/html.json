This proportion of time is abbreviated as p-value\n\nIn other words p-value=P(ø/H),i.e., given the null (H), what is the probability of data(ø)\n\nbut p-value is an answer to a question we didn't intend to ask. So what to do with it?\n\nTraditional Answers\n\n### Fisher\n\nTreat it as a measure of strength of evidence.\n\n`This is not objectively satisfactory because, p-value=P(ø/H)≠P(H/ø)`\n\n### Neyman-Pearson decision framework\n\nIn each experiment, if you need to choose between the Null and the alternative, then there is possibility for two types of errors\n\n> False Positive: Choosing the alternative when Null is true\n>\n> False Negative: Choosing the Null when the alternative is true\n\nControl the rate at which you commit decision errors of false positive type by applying a strict procedure to each experiment:\n\nThe researcher has to make a decision. In research, convention is to choose the alternative hypothesis if the test result is outside the 95% mark in the normal curve. The remaining 5% is called œ. The boundary is approximately 1.96z, ie, 1.96 standard deviations away from the mean.\n\n`A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values.`\n\nZ-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.\n\n`œ is the zone of rejection of null hypothesis and z the boundary between the acceptance and rejection zones of null hypothesis.`\n\nIf we refer the statistical charts, p value for a z score of ≤1.96 is ≤0.05\n\n### Decision framework\n\nSo the decision framework is to\n\n-   Compute p-value\n\n-   Fail to reject the Null if p-value is \\> α\n\n-   Reject the Null if p-value is \\<= α\n\nTypically α is set at 0.05\n\n### Bayesian approach\n\nBayesian approach is more humane and direct. The researcher 'should' have prior believes about the probability of null and alternate hypotheses. She then construct a posterior probability of null from the joint probability of finding data for null p(d,H~0~) and the marginal probability of data p(d)\n\np(H~0~\\|d) = p(d,H~0~)/p(d) = p(d\\|H~0~)\\* p(H~0~)/p(d)\n\n## Confidence Interval\n\nUnder repeated sampling in hypothetical world, 95% of confidence intervals constructed the same way will include the true value of the mean difference.\n\nIt ranges between a fixed value x and y on either side of zero,i.e., x-0-y.\n\n0-x is the lower confidence limit and 0+y is the upper confidence limit.\n\n### Confidence limit\n\nThis sets the boundary of confidence interval and it is generally taken as 95%.\n\nConfidence interval is generally considered as more important than p value because it gives\n\n-   Statistical significance\n\n-   Clinical significance\n\n-   Precision\n",
