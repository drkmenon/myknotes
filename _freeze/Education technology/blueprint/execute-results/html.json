As the saying goes, \\`“assessment is the tail that wags the curriculum dog.”\n\nThe teacher, however, wants her to **learn the subject** itself. This creates a **significant misalignment** between teaching, learning, and assessment.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The complaints from students\n\n![](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c14/4552073/79aeac9508f1/IJABMR-5-76-g001.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The great misalignment\n\n![](images/clipboard-102624561.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## How to align?\n\n![](images/clipboard-2078557280.png)\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Answer is Blueprinting\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: callout-important\n## Learning Objectives\n\n-   Define blue printing\n\n-   Demonstrate blueprinting using a spreadsheet\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Definition\n\nBlueprint is a <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' id='webex-55b1c10846a20a0761ed9bfe33b54b55' size='5' data-answer='bhcPUBMTbQ=='/> and a specification for an assessment program which ensures that all aspects of the curriculum and educational domains are covered by assessment programs over a specified period of time.\n\nIn general, the aim of the blueprinting is to reduce the two major threats to validity:\n\nconstruct under-representation (CU), and\n\nconstruct irrelevance variance (CIV).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Construct under-representation (CU)\n\nCU refers to under sampling or biased sampling of the content domain or the course contents. There may be too few items to sample domain adequately.\n\n### Construct irrelevance variance (CIV)\n\nCIV is a systematic error introduced into assessment data by the unrelated variables. This means inclusion of flawed item formats, too easy or too difficult questions or examiner bias. For example, tendency to test favorite, or hot or trivial topics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Attributes of assessment\n\n-   Validity\n\n-   Reliability\n\n-   Accountability\n\n-   Flexibility\n\n-   Comprehensiveness\n\n-   Timeliness\n\n-   Relevance\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## How to blueprint an assessment?\n\n### Find out and select 5 competencies\n\nNMC has published the UG curriculum. [Go to the NMC website](https://www.nmc.org.in/information-desk/for-colleges/ug-curriculum/), select the appropriate volume and select top 5 competencies from your subject.\n\n### Open a spreadsheet\n\nSee this [google sheet with sample blueprint](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXwZATnu_TilYJ2INPd8A910OucE27zgOPNzBo07ddI/edit?usp=sharing) and create one blueprint for the selected competencies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n``` quizdown\n\n# What is blueprinting (single choice)? \n\n> It's a map!         \n\n1.
