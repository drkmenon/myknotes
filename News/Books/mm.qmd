Gregor Samsa, to himself, was a machine—one that worked like clockwork until it suddenly stopped one day. To his family, he was a mere source of income; once broken, he became nothing more than a useless burden. To his office, he was a cog in the system, one that couldn’t afford to fail.

Samsa, once unable to work, was reduced to being just a [useless](https://www.knotes.co.in/news/dumping%20ground/rel) insect. His death would liberate everyone from the weight of his existence.
