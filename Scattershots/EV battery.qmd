## Types of battery

Most commonly used EV battery today are Li- ion. They include

-   LFP: Lithium iron phosphate

-   NMC: Nickel Manganese Cobalt

## Comparison of LFP and NMC Li-ion battery

| LFP                                | NMC                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cheap (\$ 100/unit)                | `Costly`                          |
| Less thermal run away              | `More thermal run away`           |
| Safe to charge 100%                | `Less safe for 100% charge`       |
| `Less energy density`              | More energy density               |
| Life is \~ 3000 cycles of charge   | `Life is ~ 1500 cycles of charge` |
| `Sub-par range & charging in cold` | Temperature insensitive           |
