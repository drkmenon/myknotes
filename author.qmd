I am a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sr Consultant of Paediatric Orthopaedic division, Amala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thrissur. Beyond medicine, I am driven by a deep passion for Chess and Catallactics. These interests not only provide intellectual stimulation but also influence my perspectives and opinions, which may occasionally manifest on this platform.
