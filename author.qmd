I am a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sr Consultant of Paediatric Orthopaedic division, Amala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thrissur. After medical school, I completed my residency in Orthopaedic Surgery at Government Medical College, Calicut and a fellowship in Trauma and Orthopaedics from Royal College of Surgeons, England. I am awarded FACS by American College of Surgeons in 2020. 

I have authored several web of science indexed articles and have authored and/or edited book chapter. My research interests include fracture healing and bone brain cross talk, in which I am currently persuing a PhD from KUHS.

Beyond medicine, I am driven by a deep passion for Chess and Economics. These interests not only provide intellectual stimulation but also influence my perspectives and opinions, which may occasionally manifest on this platform.
