I am a Professor of Orthopaedics. Currently I am pursuing a PhD in orthopaedics and my research interests include fracture healing and cross talk between brain and bone. I lead the Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery in a tertiary teaching hospital.

This compilation represents a collection of notes and insights I have gathered over the years, primarily focusing on topics related to Assymetry, Biometry, Orthopaedics, Medical Education, Health economics and my general experiences in the field. It serves as a reflection of my journey and learning in these areas, encapsulating both the technical aspects of these subjects and the practical experiences I have encountered.
