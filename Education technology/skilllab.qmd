## 1. General Principles
- Every medical institution should establish a skills laboratory to provide students with hands-on training on essential clinical skills.
- The skills lab offers a controlled, simulated environment where students can practice and refine their techniques before direct patient interaction.
- The lab aims to replicate real-world clinical scenarios, ensuring students develop competencies in clinical, psychomotor, communication, and teamwork skills.

## 2. Minimum Infrastructure Requirements
- The skills lab should cover at least **2000 sq. ft** for every **100 students**.
- There should be **at least 4 rooms** (preferably 8) for patient or standardized/simulated patient examinations.
- **Video recording and review facilities** are essential for teaching communication skills.
- Additional spaces should include:
  - A **demonstration room** for skill training in small groups.
  - A **debriefing area** for feedback sessions.
  - **Storage facilities** for mannequins and other equipment.
  - A **room for faculty coordinators** and support staff.
  - **Dedicated technical and support staff** for maintenance and operations.

## 3. Suggested Equipment and Training Modules
For **100 students**, the skills lab should include part-time task trainers, models, and mannequins for:

1. First aid, bandaging, and splinting (n=4)
2. Basic Life Support (BLS) and CPR mannequins (n=4)
3. Injection techniques (Subcutaneous, Intramuscular, Intravenous) (n=5)
4. Urinary catheter insertion (male & female adaptable) (n=4)
5. Skin & fascia suturing (n=5)
6. Breast examination model
7. Gynecological examination model (including IUCD training model)
8. Obstetric mannequins for examinations, vaginal delivery management
9. Neonatal & pediatric resuscitation mannequins
10. Whole-body mannequins and trauma mannequins (optional)

- Each training module should include clear **objectives, methods, and assessment criteria**.
- Hybrid models may be incorporated, utilizing standardized patients, real patients, or computer simulations.

## 4. Faculty and Administration
- A **Skills Lab Training Unit (STU)** should be formed, headed by the Principal and comprising faculty from different departments.
- The STU should include at least **8 faculty members**, with representation from General Surgery, General Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, and Orthopedics.
- At least **50% of the faculty** should hold the rank of Associate Professor or higher.
- A **Coordinator and Co-coordinator** (Professors) should be appointed from surgical and medical specialties.

## 5. Duties and Responsibilities of the STU
1. Ensure **proper logistics and functionality** of the skills lab.
2. Oversee the **utilization of the skills lab** for training and assessments based on predefined modules.
3. Organize **skill lab management workshops** for faculty and annual orientation programs.
4. Conduct **regular review meetings** and audits to assess lab utilization.
5. Submit **monitoring and utilization reports** as required.
6. Supervise and support **technical and support staff**.

## 6. Financial Considerations
The institution should allocate funds for:

- **Infrastructure development** of the skills lab.
- **Procurement and maintenance** of mannequins and skill stations.
- **Faculty training programs**.
- **Salaries for support staff**.

## 7. Training Modules and Assessments
- The skills lab should implement structured training modules that define the **preparation, procedures, and assessment** criteria.
- Standardized assessment methods should be followed to ensure uniform competency development among medical students.
