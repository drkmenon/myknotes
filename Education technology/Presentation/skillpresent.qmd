## What is Skill?

-   Conventionally taken as part of psycho-motor domain
-   "Any action which has a measurable impact on outcome"

## Different types of skills

-   Intellectual or Cognitive skill

-   Psychomotor or Procedural skill

-   Communication skill

-   Team skill

## Intellectual skills needed to solve the puzzle

-   **Problem-Solving:** 

    -   breaking down the puzzle into smaller problems

    -   identifying potential solutions, and

    -   evaluating their effectiveness.

-   **Critical Thinking:** 

    -   analyzing the puzzle,

    -   identifying patterns, and

    -   making logical deductions to determine the correct sequence of moves.

-   **Perseverance**

-   **Attention to Detail**

## **Teaching reasoning**

Key concept is to activate prior knowledge

-   One minute preceptor (OMP)

-   SNAPPS

-   Mini-CEX

## **One Minute Preceptor**

-   Ask for a Commitment

-   Probe for Supporting Evidence

-   Provide Positive Feedback - what was done well

-   Guidance - Errors / Omissions

-   Teach General Principle

-   Conclusion

## **One Minute Preceptor**

## **SNAPPS model**

-   **S**ummarize the case

-   **N**arrow the differential diagnosis

-   **A**nalyse the differentials

-   **P**robe the preceptor about uncertainties

-   **P**lan management

## **Teaching Psychomotor Skills**

### **Peyton’s Four-Step Approach – Cognitive, Integrative, Autonomous Phases**

| Phase         | Activity                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Demonstrate   | Trainer demonstrates                              |
| De construct  | Trainer describes the steps and demonstrates      |
| Comprehension | Learner describes the steps, trainer demonstrates |
| Performance   | Learner describes the steps and demonstrates      |

## **SPIKES-A Method for communication**

-   **S**etting up the interview

-   **A**ssessing patient’s Perception

-   Obtain **I**nvitation

-   Giving **K**nowledge and Information

-   Addressing patient’s **E**motions with empathic response

-   **S**trategy and Summary

## Another way of looking

| Technical                | Non-technical         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| History taking           | Situational awareness |
| Physical examination     | Task management       |
| Communication (patients) | Communication (team)  |
| Procedural skills        | Decision making       |
| Information management   | Prioritization skills |

## Few definitions

-   Competency is a quality characterised by observability and demonstrability

-   Skill is ability to do something which is measurable

-   Objective is what we want the student to learn/do

-   Curriculum

-   Syllabus

## Take Home Message

-   NMC has specified the methods for skill teaching (Skills module)
-   We should at least be able to enumerate them and practice some of the methods.
-   We should be able to create and execute a lesson plan for skill teaching.
-   We are dealing with NOVICE ADULTS
-   "Though this be madness, yet there is method in't?" - Shakespeare
