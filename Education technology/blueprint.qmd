## Why blueprinting?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Introduction

-   **Curriculum** is the path NMC want the students to take to make them **competent**.

-   We **assess** the student to find out whether she has learned the subject.

-   Student **learn** during the course of the MBBS program to **pass the exam**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For an average student, **assessment becomes the curriculum** — she focuses primarily on **how to pass the exam**. As the saying goes,`“assessment is the tail that wags the curriculum dog.”`

The teacher, however, wants her to **learn the subject** itself. This creates a **significant misalignment** between teaching, learning, and assessment.

## Definition

Blueprint is a `r forms_schoice(c("map","compass"),c(TRUE,FALSE),display="dropdown")` and a specification for an assessment program which ensures that all aspects of the curriculum and educational domains are covered by assessment programs over a specified period of time.

In general, the aim of the blueprinting is to reduce the two major threats to validity:

construct under-representation (CU), and

construct irrelevance variance (CIV).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Construct under-representation (CU)

CU refers to under sampling or biased sampling of the content domain or the course contents. There may be too few items to sample domain adequately.

### Construct irrelevance variance (CIV)

CIV is a systematic error introduced into assessment data by the unrelated variables. This means inclusion of flawed item formats, too easy or too difficult questions or examiner bias. For example, tendency to test favorite, or hot or trivial topics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Attributes of assessment

-   Validity

-   Reliability

-   Accountability

-   Flexibility

-   Comprehensiveness

-   Timeliness

-   Relevance

## How to blueprint an assessment?

Below is a sample blueprint of 6 competencies of MBBS curriculum. First column is the list of topics with the competency number. That is followed by:

### Importance and Frequency

They are the most crucial variable in the blueprint. We define them subjectively on a predefined scale (say, of 10). It could be compared to VAS for pain. Ideally all faculty in the department should sit together and decide on the values to be entered.

Importance and Frequency in each raw is multiplied to get **IF.**

e.g.: For the first topic, Importance is 4 and frequency is 2. So the **I F** is 8. For the entire subject, we get the total **I F** by adding all the values together in that column. Here it is 190.

### Marks Factor

The whole exercise is to get the marks factor for each topic. $I F / Total I F$ is the simple formula to get marks factor. In our e.g., for the first topic,

Marks factor is $8/190=0.0421$.

We round that figure to 2 decimal places, i.e., 0.04.

### Deciding the marks for the question

Assume that we are going to conduct an exam for 100 marks. $Marks Factor X 100$ gives the marks we are supposed to assign for each topic.

In our example, it is $0.04 X 100 = 4$. So the first topic should be assigned 4 marks in the question paper.

### Assigning difficulty level

Now that we have decided on the marks, each question can be sub divided based on [Blooms taxonomy](https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/) (from **remembering** to **creating**). In our example we have used only first 3 levels of learning.

### Do it yourself

NMC has published the UG curriculum. [Go to the NMC website](https://www.nmc.org.in/information-desk/for-colleges/ug-curriculum/), select the appropriate volume and select top 5 competencies from your subject.

### Open a spreadsheet

See this [google sheet with sample blueprint](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXwZATnu_TilYJ2INPd8A910OucE27zgOPNzBo07ddI/edit?usp=sharing) and create one blueprint for the selected competencies.

## Self assessment

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(exams)
library(exams2forms)

exm <- list("exams/ex1.Rmd", "exams/ex2.Rmd", "exams/ex3.Rmd", "exams/ex4.Rmd", "exams/ex5.Rmd")

```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results="asis"}
exams2forms(exm)
```
