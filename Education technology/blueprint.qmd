## Introduction

-   **Curriculum** is the path NMC want the students to take to make them **competent**.

-   We **assess** the student to find out whether she has learned the subject.

-   Student **learn** during the course of the MBBS program to **pass the exam**.
:::

For an average student, **assessment becomes the curriculum** — she focuses primarily on **how to pass the exam**. As the saying goes, `“assessment is the tail that wags the curriculum dog.”`

The teacher, however, wants her to **learn the subject** itself. This creates a **significant misalignment** between teaching, learning, and assessment.

## The complaints from students

-   Demonstrate blueprinting using a spreadsheet

## Definition

Blueprint is a map and a specification for an assessment program which ensures that all aspects of the curriculum and educational domains are covered by assessment programs over a specified period of time.

In general, the aim of the blueprinting is to reduce the two major threats to validity:

construct under-representation (CU), and

construct irrelevance variance (CIV).

### Construct under-representation (CU)

CU refers to under sampling or biased sampling of the content domain or the course contents. There may be too few items to sample domain adequately.

### Construct irrelevance variance (CIV)

CIV is a systematic error introduced into assessment data by the unrelated variables. This means inclusion of flawed item formats, too easy or too difficult questions or examiner bias. For example, tendency to test favorite, or hot or trivial topics.

### Find out and select 5 competencies

NMC has published the UG curriculum. [Go to the NMC website](https://www.nmc.org.in/information-desk/for-colleges/ug-curriculum/), select the appropriate volume and select top 5 competencies from your subject.

### Open a spreadsheet

See this [google sheet with sample blueprint](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXwZATnu_TilYJ2INPd8A910OucE27zgOPNzBo07ddI/edit?usp=sharing) and create one blueprint for the selected competencies.
