## Message from Organising chairman

"***Registration for the next online course on bone pathology and tumors is now open**. I am attaching the brochure. Apart from inviting you, I kindly request you to share this invitation with your friends and juniors and encourage them to join. This time, three prominent figures in their respective fields at the national level will be joining us. This definitely makes the course more attractive and authentic. Expecting good support from all of you.*"
