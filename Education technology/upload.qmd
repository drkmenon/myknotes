## Motivation

The National Medical Commission mandates the conduct of scenario-based MCQs for undergraduate students. A common practice is to write a few questions on paper, have them typed by a clerk, and then conduct the exam. Afterwards, the answer sheets are collected, evaluated manually, marks are totaled, and the mark list is prepared before publishing the results. This process is time-consuming, repetitive, and leaves room for errors and malpractice at several stages.

By contrast, if a comprehensive question bank is prepared in advance and stored in Moodle, exams can be conducted at short notice. The only significant manual task would then be the careful preparation and validation of a high-quality question bank.

## NMC mandated theory question format

1.  LAQ: 1 question for 10 marks

2.  Applied SAQ: 4 questions of 5 marks each

3.  Scenario MCQ: 10-20 questions of 1-2 marks each

4.  Reasoning: 5 questions of 3 marks each

5.  SAQ: 3 questions of 5 marks each

6.  SAQ (including 1 ATCOM): 4 questions of 5 marks each

## How to create a question bank?

It involves basically 3 steps

1.  Type the required questions and answers in a text editor.

2.  Convert them into a **Moodle-compatible format.**

3.  Upload the formatted file to the appropriate course in Moodle.

## Moodle compatible formats

-   Embedded answers (Cloze)

-   Examview

-   **GIFT format**

-   Missing word format

-   Moodle XML format

-   WebCT format

## GIFT

### Good Things to Be Aware Of

#### Question Name

Where no question name is specified, the entire question is used as the question name by default.

#### Feedback

Feedback can be included for each answer. To add feedback, follow an answer with the number sign/hash mark, and then the feedback text.\
::Q_02\
::What colour is the sky?\
{ \~%-100% \# Yellow comment on wrong answer 1 goes here\
\~%50% \# Blue comment on correct answer 1 goes here\
\~%50% \# Black comment on correct answer 2 goes here\
\~%-100% \# Green comment on wrong answer 2 goes here }
