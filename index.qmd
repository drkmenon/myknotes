Contents are best viewed on a screen 10 inches or larger.

This compilation represents a collection of my notes and insights gathered over the years, primarily focusing on topics related to [Research](https://www.knotes.co.in/biomedical/research%20methodology/science), [Orthopaedics](https://www.knotes.co.in/revision%20notes/basic%20science/bone), [Medical Education,](https://www.knotes.co.in/education%20technology/zotero) [Catallactics](https://www.knotes.co.in/catallactics/personal/conifers) and my general experiences in these fields. Some of the [Orthopaedics](https://www.knotes.co.in/revision%20notes/basic%20science/bone) content is a compilation of already available materials rather than original works. These are included for quick revision purposes. If you notice any copyright infringement, please inform me via email.

Everything I learn, do, or write will be added to this site over time. I hope you find the content useful and share it with others. Good luck!
