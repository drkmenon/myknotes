This compilation represents a collection of notes and insights I have gathered over the years, primarily focusing on topics related to [Research](https://www.knotes.co.in/research/research%20methodology/science), [Orthopaedics](https://www.knotes.co.in/orthopaedics/basic%20science/bone), [Medical Education](https://www.knotes.co.in/medical%20education/zotero), [Catallactics](https://www.knotes.co.in/practical%20catallactics/personal/speculation) and my general experiences in these fields. It serves as a reflection of my journey and learning in these areas, encapsulating both the technical aspects of these subjects and the practical experiences I have encountered.

Everything that I learn, do or write will be on this site sooner or later. I hope that you find the content useful and that you will share it with others. Good luck!
