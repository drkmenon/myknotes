## Scenario

Current premium for term insurance for a person aged less than 25 years for a sum assurance of 1 Cr: 5500 rupees/year.

This year's total premium for SSS (all three): around 65500/year.

Assume we pay the premium for roughly 23 years

## Thought experiment:

### Doctor A:

Joins all three SSS today at age 25.

Total premium for 23 years with 7% inflation (**`premium is not capped, so this is a conservative estimate.Premium was 12000/year 10 years back, and the inflation for last 10 years is 18%`**)

### Doctor B

Joins in a term insurance for 5500 per year for 23 years

Total payment: 110000 rupees

SIPs 5000/month for next 23 years with 12% return in an ETF

Corpus after 23 years: 72,92,362 rupees (73 Lakh rupees) + She will get 1Cr as death benefit between 25-47 years
