### **Which is the Better Choice? Term Insurance vs. SSS**

#### **Scenario:**

A 25-year-old doctor is deciding between two options for financial security:

1.  **Joining SSS plans, all three**
2.  **Taking a term insurance policy and investing separately**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Doctor A: Chooses SSS**

-   Joins all three SSS schemes at age 25.

-   Pays a yearly premium that increases over time, starting today with 65000/year.

-   **Total premium paid over 23 years:** around â‚¹35 lakh. ( Assuming a 7% annual increase (This is a conservative estimate since the premium is not capped).

    ## Most important point

    For records, the premium was â‚¹12,000 per year 10 years ago, and the annual increase over the past decade has been 18%, well above 7%.)
    :::

-   **On death, nominee gets â‚¹1 crore.**

-   **If she lives till 75:** She still get nothing (of course!) and the nominee will get â‚¹1 crore (Equivalent to â‚¹3.5 lakhs of today's money).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Doctor B: Chooses Term Insurance + Investment**

-   Takes a **term insurance** of â‚¹1 crore, paying just â‚¹5,500 per year.
-   Invests â‚¹5,000/month in an ETF growing at **12% per year**.
-   **Total premium paid for term insurance:** â‚¹1.1 lakh over 23 years.
-   **If she dies between 25-47 years:** Her nominee gets more than â‚¹1 crore from term insurance + the investment returns.
-   **Total corpus after 23 years (at age 48):** â‚¹73 lakh.
-   **If she lives till 75:** Her investments grow to **â‚¹15.5 crore.**
-   In between age 48 and 75, she will get an amount between 73L and 15 crores **whether she dies or not**
-   She may even opt out of term insurance at around 50 years of age and double the SIP to boost her retirement corpus, because she has got a â‚¹ 1 Cr corpus already available for contengencies.
