## Risk and payoff graph

Pay-off, g, is a function of x, given by f(x)=g. Let us plot **risk**, x, in x axis and **pay-off**, g, in y axis. When we go to the right in the x axis, risk goes on increasing and at one point x~2~, risk is 100%. We can loose everything deployed. Yet the reward is exponentially high to ignore,1000%!. In the extreme left, x~1~ , we can deploy the same asset with zero risk to get a modest return of 9%. Let the probability of x~1~ be p~1~ and probability of p~2~ be (1-p~1~). p~1~ is extremely likely event and p~2~ is less likely event. But for simplicity, p~1~ is around 66% and p~2~ is around 33% ( assuming that x~2~ happens when ever market moves more than 10% in either directions in 6 months). The below diagram graphically depicts the above mentioned scenario.

If all assets are deployed at x~1~, the pay-off, g, which is the f(x~1~), we can generate a return of f(E(x~1~))=9% with very high probability of success with almost zero risk. On the other hand, if we deploy all the assets at x~2~, we may generate a mind blowing return of f(E(x~2~))=1000%, but with a very high probability of 100% capital loss.

Assume we have a combination of x~1~ and x~2~. Here, Jenson's inequality says that **expected value of g will always be greater than or equal to the function of the expected value of x, given that the f(x) is convex**

$$
E(g) >= f(E(x))
$$

### Conclusion

> Never put all eggs in one basket of similar risk-pay-off profile.

Our immediate hunch will be to distribute the asset in all possible values of x to get an expected pay-off which is greater than the sum of the individual returns. Problem with this approach is the fact that we are neglecting the play of probability where the moral expectation is the true pay-off or return.

::: callout-caution
In other words, the true return is not the arithmetic mean, it is the geometric mean of probability weighted return on capital.

Then, what should be our strategy?

It is impossible to predict the future return. What we can do is try to domesticate uncertainty by limiting the downside risk to minimum fixed value while keeping all the upside risks untouched.

## Best of both worlds

ยง1. Deploy almost all assets in a risk free instrument and use a small amount of capital to speculate in a highly convex instrument

ยง2. Deploy almost all assets in a moderately risky instrument and take insurance against downside

## Assumptions

-   You have a substantial corpus

-   Your time horizon is moderate

-   Your contributions are relatively small when compared to the corpus which you want to grow and protect.
